API and programmer documentation for PEACE: Parallel Environment for
Assembly and Clustering of gene Expressions.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>PEACE is essentially a parallel and distributed clustering software
system.  It consists of two main components. The core clustering is
performed by a standalone software subsystem. The core clustering
engine has been developed in C++ and utilizes the Message Passing
Library (MPI) to enable parallel and distributed clustering of large
data sets of sequenced transcript fragments.</p>

<p>The second component of PEACE is a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
that has been developed in Java to serve as an integrated clustering
and analysis workbench. This documentation provides detailed
information about the software system constituting PEACE GUI. This
documentation is primarily intended for use by programmers who wish to
further enhance or modify PEACE to suit their needs.</p>

<p>As of 2010, PEACE is actively maintained and managed by the
original authors at Miami University, Oxford, OH. If you would like
enhancements or changes to PEACE, feel free to contact the
authors. Contact and additional information is available off PEACE
website at: <a href="http://www.peace-tools.org/">
