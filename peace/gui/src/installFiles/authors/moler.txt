James Moler assisted Dr. Dhananjai Rao in developing<br>
the PEACE software.  Foremost among his contributions<br>
is designing the two-pass D2 algorithm, a refinement of<br>
the original D2 distance metric.  He also contributed to<br>
efficient implementations of heuristics, testing the software,<br>
and fixing errors.  In addition, he conducted statistical<br>
tests of the tool on simulated and real data sets.</i>
