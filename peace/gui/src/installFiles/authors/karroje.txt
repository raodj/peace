<i> John Karro contributed to the development of the<br>
algorithms underlying Peace, consulted on the tool<br>
development, provided background biological knowledge, and<br>
organized and directed the testing and statistical analysis<br>
of results.  He is currently conducting a statistical analysis<br>
of the d2 distance metric for the purposes of parameter<br>
optimization, and is directing efforts to extend PEACE into the<br>
problem of transcript assembly and isoform differentiation. </i>
