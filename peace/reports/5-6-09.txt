Informal Report for Week of 4/27/09

Early in the week, a bug in the construction of heuristic chains was 
discovered and fixed.  The implementation of the UV heuristic was 
verified and fixed.  Some research was done on the Trac system as a 
potential solution for project management, providing a layer on top of 
Subversion.

Later in the week, a great deal of progress was made as the TV heuristic 
was added to the system and the operation of both heuristics was 
verified.  The code was cleaned up and optimizations were made across 
the board.  This began a dedicated process of optimizing Peace code and 
comparing its performance to wcd in terms of execution time.  As of this 
writing, wcd is still faster than Peace, although the gap has become 
much smaller.  There are no conclusive results as far as the clustering 
quality of Peace compared to wcd's, though some tests on simulated 
EST data have been performed.
