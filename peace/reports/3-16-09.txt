Informal Report for Week of 3/9/09

Ran 56 iterations of a test comparing the clustering quality of Peace 
and WCD using 5000 ESTs taken from 100 source sequences.  Found that 
Peace's quality was slightly higher than WCD's using both quality 
indices (Younden and Rand).

Observed a strange error related to Peace "hanging" near program 
termination.  Discussed with Dr. Rao and made plans to track and debug 
this issue.

Also observed that WCD's results were slightly better than Peace's for
tests run on greater numbers of ESTs (7500, 8000, 9000).  Dr. Rao 
observed that this could be related to the "threshold value" used by 
Peace for MST clustering, which is calculated based on the mean and 
variance of distances in the cluster.  Plan to begin experimenting with 
this threshold value for 10000 ESTs and see what effect it has on the
quality of the clustering.

During this week, support for heuristics was also added to Peace.
