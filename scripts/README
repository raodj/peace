pipeline.py - The main peace-wcd pipeline script.
   This script takes a lot of parameters, so they are not discussed in this
   readme.  See script.pdf for a manual on running this script.

gui.pyw - The GUI that was in development for the pipeline script.
   Currently does not do anything.

format.py - The format script called by the pipeline script to format FASTA
   files, making them manageable for peace/wcd and for the pipeline script's
   analysis routines.  This version of the script selects a certain number
   of ESTs (hardcoded, but it is at the top of the file and can easily be
   modified) to use for analysis, instead of running peace/wcd on all ESTs.
   This script also handles the random shuffling of ESTs.

   Note that if you are running the pipeline script, format.py will be called
   as part of the script, so you do not need to run it yourself.

formatNoSelect.py - A version of the format script that runs on all the ESTs.

sort.py - A version of the format script that, instead of randomly shuffling
   ESTs, places them in sorted order (by source sequence and by start index).
   This was used for the creation of graphical data.

multiruns.py - A helper script to run multiple iterations of some 
   parameters using the pipeline script.  Takes one parameter n, and
   proceeds to run the pipeline script n times.  Reports only the 
   Younden and Rand indexes (no other data) and handles cleanup of 
   the pipeline script's output files each time.  Writes all output to 
   the file "multiRunOutput.txt".
   The parameters to be used for running the pipeline are hardcoded at 
   the moment but could easily be changed.
