	/**
	 * Get the overlap distance of the two strings. 
	 * This function 
	 * 	1) tries to find the position with the minimal d2 distance;
	 * 	2) uses alignment to get the similarity value of two substrings. And it sets 
	 * 		the similarity value to be the overlap distance of s1 and s2.
	 * 
	 * The function finds the position in s2 which has the smallest d2 distance between s1's first window and 
	 * s2 or between s1's last window and s2. If it finds the position, it returns the overlap length and the
	 * overlap distance of the two strings. If not, it returns INT_MAX. If it finds two positions for both the 
	 * first and last window in s1, it chooses the one with the smaller distance.
	 * Specifically, if the function finds the position, it returns three kinds of values.
	 * 		If s2 is to the left of s1, the values(overlap length and distance) are negative integer;
	 * 		If s2 is to the right of s1, the values(overlap length and distance) are positive integer;
	 * 		If s1 and s2 has inclusion, the overlap distance is INT_MIN.
	 * 
	 * @param s1 String the first string, s2 String the second string, d2Dis int d2 distance.
	 * @return the first element is the overlap length, the second is the overlap distance.
	 * If s2 is to the left of s1, the length are negative, the distance is zero or negative.
	 * If s2 is to the right of s1, the length are positive, the distance is zero or positive.
	 * If no overlap is found, the distance is INT_MAX.
	 * If s2 is included in s1, the distance is INT_MIN.
	 * If s1 is included in s2, the distance is INT_MIN.
