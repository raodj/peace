Informal Report for Week of 5/4/09

Work on optimizing Peace's performance continued in this week.  Some 
performance testing was done via a profiler and statistical 
instrumentation.  It was determined that the parts of the analysis 
incurring the greatest performance costs were the UV heuristic and the 
D2 algorithm.  The UV heuristic incurrs a high performance cost simply 
because of the sheer volume of calls; the D2 algorithm is O(n^2) so one 
would have expected a high performance cost.

It was observed that wcd's implementation of the UV heuristic is split 
into two loops.  In the first loop, half of the words to be checked are 
checked for matches.  If a certain number of matches is not found, the 
heuristic returns false.  Otherwise, it proceeds to the second loop, 
where the other half of the words are checked.  Empirically, the first 
loop takes up the most time by far, so wcd is saving time by using this 
two-loop approach.  We were able to save even more time by splitting it 
into three loops, and have parameterized this "multiple pass" 
capability in our implementation of the UV heuristic.

It was also observed that wcd is performing a significantly smaller 
number of D2 comparisons, and that this has to do with the method of 
constructing the clusters.  Currently, alternative approaches toward 
building the minimum spanning tree are being investigated.  It is 
believed that, if the number of D2 calls in Peace can be cut down to a 
number close to wcd's, Peace will end up with better performance.
