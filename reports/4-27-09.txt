Informal Report for Weeks of 4/6/09, 4/13/09, 4/20/09

The analysis of D2 scores for unrelated EST sequences was completed, and
based on these results, the decision was made to fix Peace's clustering 
threshold value at 130.

Tests were run on the performance of Peace versus WCD using a fixed 
threshold of 40 for both programs, and it was found that WCD slightly
outperformed Peace on the clustering quality indices.  It is possible,
however, that Peace's method of clustering works better using a higher
threshold value.  Plans have been made to run the same tests using a
clustering threshold of 130 for both programs when time permits.

A bug related to heuristic chains was fixed in the Peace code, and the
code underwent some general cleanup and refactoring to prepare it for 
heuristic development.  In addition, an interactive console feature was 
added to the program.

The actual development of heuristics did not progress much, but some 
ideas have been generated and the next few weeks should feature more
dedicated development and testing.
