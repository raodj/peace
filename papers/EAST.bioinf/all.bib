title = {Distinct changes of genomic biases in nucleotide substitution at the time of Mammalian radiation},
abstract = {Differences in the regional substitution patterns in the human genome created patterns of large-scale variation of base composition known as genomic isochores. To gain insight into the origin of the genomic isochores, we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to determine the history of substitution patterns in the human genome. This approach utilizes the vast amount of repetitive sequence deposited in the human genome over the past approximately 250 Myr. Using this approach, we estimate the frequencies of seven types of substitutions: the four transversions, two transitions, and the methyl-assisted transition of cytosine in CpG. Comparing substitutional patterns in repetitive elements of various ages, we reconstruct the history of the base-substitutional process in the different isochores for the past 250 Myr. At around 90 MYA (around the time of the mammalian radiation), we find an abrupt fourfold to eightfold increase of the cytosine transition rate in CpG pairs compared with that of the reptilian ancestor. Further analysis of nucleotide substitutions in regions with different GC content reveals concurrent changes in the substitutional patterns. Although the substitutional pattern was dependent on the regional GC content in such ways that it preserved the regional GC content before the mammalian radiation, it lost this dependence afterward. The substitutional pattern changed from an isochore-preserving to an isochore-degrading one. We conclude that isochores have been established before the radiation of the eutherian mammals and have been subject to the process of homogenization since then.},

title = {Protein complex prediction via cost-based clustering},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Understanding principles of cellular organization and function can be enhanced if we detect known and predict still undiscovered protein complexes within the cell's protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Such predictions may be used as an inexpensive tool to direct biological experiments. The increasing amount of available PPI data necessitates an accurate and scalable approach to protein complex identification. RESULTS: We have developed the Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering Algorithm (RNSC) to efficiently partition networks into clusters using a cost function. We applied this cost-based clustering algorithm to PPI networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to identify and predict protein complexes. We have determined functional and graph-theoretic properties of true protein complexes from the MIPS database. Based on these properties, we defined filters to distinguish between identified network clusters and true protein complexes. Conclusions: Our application of the cost-based clustering algorithm provides an accurate and scalable method of detecting and predicting protein complexes within a PPI network.},

title = {Adaptive evolution of young gene duplicates in mammals},
abstract = {Duplicate genes act as a source of genetic material from which new functions arise. They exist in large numbers in every sequenced eukaryotic genome and may be responsible for many differences in phenotypes between species. However, recent work searching for the targets of positive selection in humans has largely ignored duplicated genes due to complications in orthology assignment. Here we find that a high proportion of young gene duplicates in the human, macaque, mouse, and rat genomes have experienced adaptive natural selection. Approximately 10% of all lineage-specific duplicates show evidence for positive selection on their protein sequences, larger than any reported amount of selection among single-copy genes in these lineages using similar methods. We also find that newly duplicated genes that have been transposed to new chromosomal locations are significantly more likely to have undergone positive selection than the ancestral copy. Human-specific duplicates evolving under adaptive natural selection include a surprising number of genes involved in neuronal and cognitive functions. Our results imply that genome scans for selection that ignore duplicated loci are missing a large fraction of all adaptive substitutions. The results are also in agreement with the classical model of evolution by gene duplication, supporting a common role for neofunctionalization in the long-term maintenance of gene duplicates.},

title = {Annotation, submission and screening of repetitive elements in Repbase: RepbaseSubmitter and Censor},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Repbase is a reference database of eukaryotic repetitive DNA, which includes prototypic sequences of repeats and basic information described in annotations. Updating and maintenance of the database requires specialized tools, which we have created and made available for use with Repbase, and which may be useful as a template for other curated databases. RESULTS: We describe the software tools RepbaseSubmitter and Censor, which are designed to facilitate updating and screening the content of Repbase. RepbaseSubmitter is a java-based interface for formatting and annotating Repbase entries. It eliminates many common formatting errors, and automates actions such as calculation of sequence lengths and composition, thus facilitating curation of Repbase sequences. In addition, it has several features for predicting protein coding regions in sequences; searching and including Pubmed references in Repbase entries; and searching the NCBI taxonomy database for correct inclusion of species information and taxonomic position. Censor is a tool to rapidly identify repetitive elements by comparison to known repeats. It uses WU-BLAST for speed and sensitivity, and can conduct DNA-DNA, DNA-protein, or translated DNA-translated DNA searches of genomic sequence. Defragmented output includes a map of repeats present in the query sequence, with the options to report masked query sequence(s), repeat sequences found in the query, and alignments. CONCLUSION: Censor and RepbaseSubmitter are available as both web-based services and downloadable versions. They can be found at http://www.girinst.org/repbase/submission.html (RepbaseSubmitter) and http://www.girinst.org/censor/index.php (Censor).},

title = {Neofunctionalization of duplicated genes under the pressure of gene conversion},
abstract = {Neofunctionalization occurs when a neofunctionalized allele is fixed in one of duplicated genes. This is a simple fixation process if duplicated genes accumulate mutations independently. However, the process is very complicated when duplicated genes undergo concerted evolution by gene conversion. Our simulations demonstrate that the process could be described with three distinct stages. First, a newly arisen neofunctionalized allele increases in frequency by selection, but gene conversion prevents its complete fixation. These two factors (selection and gene conversion) that work in opposite directions create an equilibrium, and the time during which the frequency of the neofunctionalized allele drifts around the equilibrium value is called the temporal equilibrium stage. During this temporal equilibrium stage, it is possible that gene conversion is inactivated by mutations, which allow the complete fixation of the neofunctionalized allele. And then, permanent neofunctionalization is achieved. This article develops basic population genetics theories on the process to permanent neofunctionalization under the pressure of gene conversion. We obtain the probability and time that the frequency of a newly arisen neofunctionalized allele reaches the equilibrium value. It is also found that during the temporal equilibrium stage, selection exhibits strong signature in the divergence in the DNA sequences between the duplicated genes. The spatial distribution of the divergence likely has a peak around the site targeted by selection. We provide an analytical expression of the pattern of divergence and apply it to the human red- and green-opsin genes. The theoretical prediction well fits the data when we assume that selection is operating for the two amino acid differences in exon 5, which are believed to account for the major part of the functional difference between the red and green opsins.},

title = {TopNet: a tool for comparing biological sub-networks, correlating protein properties with topological statistics},
abstract = {Biological networks are a topic of great current interest, particularly with the publication of a number of large genome-wide interaction datasets. They are globally characterized by a variety of graph-theoretic statistics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and diameter. Moreover, real protein networks are quite complex and can often be divided into many sub-networks through systematic selection of different nodes and edges. For instance, proteins can be sub-divided by expression level, length, amino-acid composition, solubility, secondary structure and function. A challenging research question is to compare the topologies of sub- networks, looking for global differences associated with different types of proteins. TopNet is an automated web tool designed to address this question, calculating and comparing topological characteristics for different sub-networks derived from any given protein network. It provides reasonable solutions to the calculation of network statistics for sub-networks embedded within a larger network and gives simplified views of a sub-network of interest, allowing one to navigate through it. After constructing TopNet, we applied it to the interaction networks and protein classes currently available for yeast. We were able to find a number of potential biological correlations. In particular, we found that soluble proteins had more interactions than membrane proteins. Moreover, amongst soluble proteins, those that were highly expressed, had many polar amino acids, and had many alpha helices, tended to have the most interaction partners. Interestingly, TopNet also turned up some systematic biases in the current yeast interaction network: on average, proteins with a known functional classification had many more interaction partners than those without. This phenomenon may reflect the incompleteness of the experimentally determined yeast interaction network.},

abstract = {Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), used as forage and grain crop is a stress tolerant species. Here we identify differentially regulated transcripts in response to abiotic (salinity, drought and cold) stresses from subtracted cDNA libraries by single-pass sequencing of cDNA clones. A total of 2,494 EST sequences were clustered and assembled into a collection of 1,850 unique sequences with 224 contigs and 1,626 singleton sequences. By sequence comparisons the putative functions of many ESTs could be assigned. Genes with stress related functions include those involved in cellular defense against abiotic stresses and transcripts for proteins involved in stress response signaling and transcription in addition to ESTs encoding unknown functions. These provide new candidate genes for investigation to elucidate their role in abiotic stress. The relative mRNA abundance of 38 selected genes, quantified using real time quantitative RT-PCR, demonstrated the existence of a complex gene regulatory network that differentially modulates gene expression in a kinetics-specific manner in response to different abiotic stresses. Notably, housekeeping and non-target genes were effectively reduced in these subtracted cDNA libraries constructed. These EST sequences are a rich source of stress-related genes and reveal a major part of the stress-response transcriptome that will provide the foundation for further studies into understanding Pennisetum's adaptability to harsh environmental conditions.},

In this paper, we develop a new algorithm for clustering vertices of a protein-protein interaction network using a density function, providing disjoint classes. RESULTS: Applied to the yeast interaction network, the classes obtained appear to be biological significant. The partitions are then used to make functional predictions for uncharacterized yeast proteins, using an annotation procedure that takes into account the binary interactions between proteins inside the classes. We show that this procedure is able to enhance the performances with respect to previous approaches. Finally, we propose a new annotation for 37 previously uncharacterized yeast proteins. CONCLUSION: We believe that our results represent a significant improvement for the inference of cellular functions, that can be applied to other organism as well as to other type of interaction graph, such as genetic interactions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In this article we build a model of the CpG dinucleotide substitution rate and use it to challenge the claim that, that rate underwent a sudden mammalian-specific increase approximately 90 million years ago. The evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from the application of a model of neutral substitution rates able to account for elevated CpG dinucleotide substitution rates. With the initial goal of improving that model's accuracy, we introduced a modification enabling us to account for boundary effects arising by the truncation of the Markov field, as well as improving the optimization procedure required for estimating the substitution rates. RESULTS: When using this modified method to reproduce the supporting analysis, the evidence of the rate shift vanished. Our analysis suggests that the CpG-specific rate has been constant over the relevant time period and that the asserted acceleration of the CpG rate is likely an artifact of the original model.},

abstract = {L1 retrotransposons constitute the largest single component of mammalian genomes. In contrast to the single remaining lineage of L1 retrotransposons in mammalian genomes, some teleost fishes contain a highly diverse L1 retrotransposon repertoire. Major evolutionary changes in L1 retrotransposon repertoires have therefore taken place in the land vertebrates (Tetrapoda). The lack of sequence data for L1 retrotransposons in the basal living Tetrapoda lineages prompted an investigation of their distribution and evolution in the genomes of the key tetrapod lineages, amphibians and reptiles, and in lungfishes. In this study, we combined genome database searches with PCR analysis to demonstrate that L1 retrotransposons are present in the genomes of lungfishes, amphibians, and lepidosaurs. Phylogenomic analysis shows that the genomes of Deuterostomia possess three highly divergent groups of L1 retrotransposons, with distinct distribution patterns. The analysis of L1 diversity shows the presence of a very large number of diverse L1 families, each with very low copy numbers, at the time of the origin of tetrapods. During the evolution of synapsids, all but one L1 lineage have been lost. This study establishes that the loss of L1 diversity and explosion in copy numbers occurred in the synapsid ancestors of mammals, and was most probably caused by severe population bottlenecks.},

title = {Human-specific duplication and mosaic transcripts: the recent paralogous structure of chromosome 22},
abstract = {In recent decades, comparative chromosomal banding, chromosome painting, and gene-order studies have shown strong conservation of gross chromosome structure and gene order in mammals. However, findings from the human genome sequence suggest an unprecedented degree of recent (<35 million years ago) segmental duplication. This dynamism of segmental duplications has important implications in disease and evolution. Here we present a chromosome-wide view of the structure and evolution of the most highly homologous duplications (> or = 1 kb and > or = 90%) on chromosome 22. Overall, 10.8% (3.7/33.8 Mb) of chromosome 22 is duplicated, with an average sequence identity of 95.4%. To organize the duplications into tractable units, intron-exon structure and well-defined duplication boundaries were used to define 78 duplicated modules (minimally shared evolutionary segments) with 157 copies on chromosome 22. Analysis of these modules provides evidence for the creation or modification of 11 novel transcripts. Comparative FISH analyses of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and macaque reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the distribution of these duplications--consistent with their recent origin. Several duplications appear to be human specific, including a approximately 400-kb duplication (99.4%-99.8% sequence identity) that transposed from chromosome 14 to the most proximal pericentromeric region of chromosome 22. Experimental and in silico data further support a pericentromeric gradient of duplications where the most recent duplications transpose adjacent to the centromere. Taken together, these data suggest that segmental duplications have been an ongoing process of primate genome evolution, contributing to recent gene innovation and the dynamic transformation of genome architecture within and among closely related species.},

title = {A jumping profile Hidden Markov Model and applications to recombination sites in HIV and HCV genomes},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Jumping alignments have recently been proposed as a strategy to search a given multiple sequence alignment A against a database. Instead of comparing a database sequence S to the multiple alignment or profile as a whole, S is compared and aligned to individual sequences from A. Within this alignment, S can jump between different sequences from A, so different parts of S can be aligned to different sequences from the input multiple alignment. This approach is particularly useful for dealing with recombination events. RESULTS: We developed a jumping profile Hidden Markov Model (jpHMM), a probabilistic generalization of the jumping-alignment approach. Given a partition of the aligned input sequence family into known sequence subtypes, our model can jump between states corresponding to these different subtypes, depending on which subtype is locally most similar to a database sequence. Jumps between different subtypes are indicative of intersubtype recombinations. We applied our method to a large set of genome sequences from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well as to simulated recombined genome sequences. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that jumps in our jumping profile HMM often correspond to recombination breakpoints; our approach can therefore be used to detect recombinations in genomic sequences. The recombination breakpoints identified by jpHMM were found to be significantly more accurate than breakpoints defined by traditional methods based on comparing single representative sequences.},

Writeupof error model sent to collaborators:

I've worked through the details of Hazelhurt's simulation, and what probabilities they use for errors.   They have put some time into this, so I suggested we use their model and not try to work this out on our own (with the exceptions noted below).  

They actually detail two different models; here I'm only going to give the parameters for the worst-case.  Jenna: I'm sticking numbers in below, but for your work you are going to want to parametrize it better.  We will go over this later.

To introduce an error they go through the following steps:

Single base errors: They take this in two steps.  First, they determine if a base has an error, then they determine what sort of error. 

To determine if it is subjected to an error:
First, they allow it to change at a probability of 0.01. 
If it did not change in (1), then they give a second change to change based on its distance from the 3' end.  This probability here is 0.02x/l, where x is the index number of the base and l is the length of the est.  (So the first base has a probability of 0 of changing for this reason, and the last base has a probability of 0.02.) 
At the end of the est things get even worse.  So if there was no change in step (1) or (2), they let it change with a probability of exp(-0.5sqrt(l-x)).  (So the first base has a probability of exp(-0.5sqrt(l)) -- very small, while the second-to-last base has a probability 0.606 and the last base has a probability of 1. 
There is also extra problems at the beginning.  So an error can happen with probability 0.5(1 -- tanh(x -- 50)).  Unlike the pervious steps they have no good way of explaining this, but claim it works well.

If a base is subjected to an error: it could be a substitution, deletion or insertion, each with probability 1/3.  (I presume that ``insertion'' means that a new base is inserted right before it.)  For insertion and substitution its not clear to me how the new base is picked; in absence of discussion, I assume that we pick from the other letters with a uniform probability.


Stuttering: This is when a subsequence gets copied.  This is apparently more likely to happen at a T or a G.

They only allow this when there is a sequence of multiple Ts or multiple Gs; they claim that the probability otherwise is negligible.  If we are at position x, let r_G(x) be the number of contiguous Gs that occur up to and including x.  (So for the sequence AGGGA, r_G(0)=0, r_G(1) = 1, r_G(2) = 2, r_G(3) = 3, and r_G(4) = 0.)  Let r_T(x) be the same for Ts.  Then the probability of a stutter (in terms of the parameter \eta) is:

        (0.5(1-cos(r_G(x)/ \eta)))^2 + (0.5(1-cos(r_T(x)/ \eta)))^2

There is a problem here, because they list the value of the parameter \eta as 0, which obviously makes no sense.  In the other experiment (the non-worst case) they list it as 20.


If stuttering does occur at index x, then the length of the insert sequence is chosen from a uniform distribution over the range (0...2*r_G(x)) or (0...2*r_T(x)).



Ligation: This is when two ESTs (possibly from different genes) get bonded together.  They put the probability of this a 0.  Its not clear to me if they do this because it doesn't really happen, or just because they don't know how to deal with it.  

Clearly, this error would be serious, as it could cause us to incorrectly join cluster together.  In the short run, I think we should follow there example and ignore it.  In the long run, I'm hoping we can come up with a detection method.  


Relevance to Chun's work: Part of Chun's work is on cleaning up the endpoints of the EST, so data we get from him will have less errors at the end.  This was have a directly effect on the probabilities being emulated in step (4) of determining if there is a single base error --- reducing that probability of error.  I suspect it will help in step (3) as well.

title = {d2_cluster: a validated method for clustering EST and full-length cDNAsequences},
abstract = {Several efforts are under way to condense single-read expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length transcript data on a large scale by means of clustering or assembly. One goal of these projects is the construction of gene indices where transcripts are partitioned into index classes (or clusters) such that they are put into the same index class if and only if they represent the same gene. Accurate gene indexing facilitates gene expression studies and inexpensive and early partial gene sequence discovery through the assembly of ESTs that are derived from genes that have yet to be positionally cloned or obtained directly through genomic sequencing. We describe d2_cluster, an agglomerative algorithm for rapidly and accurately partitioning transcript databases into index classes by clustering sequences according to minimal linkage or "transitive closure" rules. We then evaluate the relative efficiency of d2_cluster with respect to other clustering tools. UniGene is chosen for comparison because of its high quality and wide acceptance. It is shown that although d2_cluster and UniGene produce results that are between 83% and 90% identical, the joining rate of d2_cluster is between 8% and 20% greater than UniGene. Finally, we present the first published rigorous evaluation of under and over clustering (in other words, of type I and type II errors) of a sequence clustering algorithm, although the existence of highly identical gene paralogs means that care must be taken in the interpretation of the type II error. Upper bounds for these d2_cluster error rates are estimated at 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively. In other words, the sensitivity and selectivity of d2_cluster are estimated to be >99.6% and 99.2%.},

title = {EST clustering error evaluation and correction},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The gene expression intensity information conveyed by (EST) Expressed Sequence Tag data can be used to infer important cDNA library properties, such as gene number and expression patterns. However, EST clustering errors, which often lead to greatly inflated estimates of obtained unique genes, have become a major obstacle in the analyses. The EST clustering error structure, the relationship between clustering error and clustering criteria, and possible error correction methods need to be systematically investigated. RESULTS: We identify and quantify two types of EST clustering error, namely, Type I and II in EST clustering using CAP3 assembling program. A Type I error occurs when ESTs from the same gene do not form a cluster whereas a Type II error occurs when ESTs from distinct genes are falsely clustered together. While the Type II error rate is <1.5% for both 5' and 3' EST clustering, the Type I error in the 5' EST case is approximately 10 times higher than the 3' EST case (30% versus 3%). An over-stringent identity rule, e.g., P >/= 95%, may even inflate the Type I error in both cases. We demonstrate that approximately 80% of the Type I error is due to insufficient overlap among sibling ESTs (ISO error) in 5' EST clustering. A novel statistical approach is proposed to correct ISO error to provide more accurate estimates of the true gene cluster profile.},

title = {Sequencing Medicago truncatula expressed sequenced tags using 454 Life Sciences technology},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this study, we addressed whether a single 454 Life Science GS20 sequencing run provides new gene discovery from a normalized cDNA library, and whether the short reads produced via this technology are of value in gene structure annotation. RESULTS: A single 454 GS20 sequencing run on adapter-ligated cDNA, from a normalized cDNA library, generated 292,465 reads that were reduced to 252,384 reads with an average read length of 92 nucleotides after cleaning. After clustering and assembly, a total of 184,599 unique sequences were generated containing over 400 SSRs. The 454 sequences generated hits to more genes than a comparable amount of sequence from MtGI. Although short, the 454 reads are of sufficient length to map to a unique genome location as effectively as longer ESTs produced by conventional sequencing. Functional interpretation of the sequences was carried out by Gene Ontology assignments from matches to Arabidopsis and was shown to cover a broad range of GO categories. 53,796 assemblies and singletons (29%) had no match in the existing MtGI. Within the previously unobserved Medicago transcripts, thousands had matches in a comprehensive protein database and one or more of the TIGR Plant Gene Indices. Approximately 20% of these novel sequences could be found in the Medicago genome sequence. A total of 70,026 reads generated by the 454 technology were mapped to 785 Medicago finished BACs using PASA and over 1,000 gene models required modification. In parallel to 454 sequencing, 4,445 5'-prime reads were generated by conventional sequencing using the same library and from the assembled sequences it was shown to contain about 52% full length cDNAs encoding proteins from 50 to over 500 amino acids in length. CONCLUSION: Due to the large number of reads afforded by the 454 DNA sequencing technology, it is effective in revealing the expression of transcripts from a broad range of GO categories and contains many rare transcripts in normalized cDNA libraries, although only a limited portion of their sequence is uncovered. As with longer ESTs, 454 reads can be mapped uniquely onto genomic sequence to provide support for, and modifications of, gene predictions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent threat to the public posed by the dissemination of Bacillus anthracis through the US postal system has resulted in increased security measures, including electron beam irradiation for the sterilization of some mail. The deleterious effects of electron beam radiation on biological products are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effect of electron beam radiation, as currently used to sterilize packages and mail in the United States, on several standardized or characterized allergen extracts. METHODS: Selected irradiated extracts were analyzed for allergen content and potency by SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and ELISA (including inhibition) and compared with untreated extracts. RESULTS: The compositions and immunochemical potencies of these products were altered significantly by irradiation treatment. Physical changes to native protein structures observed after electrophoretic separations coincided with near-complete loss of allergenic and antigenic epitopes present on major and minor allergens, according to ELISA and immunoblot comparisons with untreated extracts. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that extracts subjected to electron beam sterilization conditions are likely to contain modified component structures and properties that might compromise the clinical effectiveness of these products.},

abstract = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

title = {Substantial regional variation in substitution rates in the human genome: importance of GC content, gene density, and telomere-specific effects},
abstract = {This study presents the first global, 1-Mbp-level analysis of patterns of nucleotide substitutions along the human lineage. The study is based on the analysis of a large amount of repetitive elements deposited into the human genome since the mammalian radiation, yielding a number of results that would have been difficult to obtain using the more conventional comparative method of analysis. This analysis revealed substantial and consistent variability of rates of substitution, with the variability ranging up to twofold among different regions. The rates of substitutions of C or G nucleotides with A or T nucleotides vary much more sharply than the reverse rates, suggesting that much of that variation is due to differences in mutation rates rather than in the probabilities of fixation of C/G vs. A/T nucleotides across the genome. For all types of substitution we observe substantially more hotspots than coldspots, with hotspots showing substantial clustering over tens of Mbp's. Our analysis revealed that GC-content of surrounding sequences is the best predictor of the rates of substitution. The pattern of substitution appears very different near telomeres compared to the rest of the genome and cannot be explained by the genome-wide correlations of the substitution rates with GC content or exon density. The telomere pattern of substitution is consistent with natural selection or biased gene conversion acting to increase the GC-content of the sequences that are within 10-15 Mbp away from the telomere.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare molecular associations between the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-New Jersey isolates of the 1995 outbreak with those from previous outbreaks between 1982 and 1985 in the western United States. SAMPLE POPULATION: 23 virus isolates considered representative of the 1995 outbreak of vesicular stomatitis. PROCEDURE: Viral gene coding for surface-envelope protein G was evaluated by use of nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Changes in up to 0.77% of the nucleotide bases and 1.35% of the amino acids were detected among the 1995 viral isolates, whereas changes in up to 3.2 and 2.9% of the nucleotides and amino acids, respectively, were found, compared with the 1982 to 1985 viruses. Insertions or deletions were not found in the entire gene, which spanned 1,554 nucleotide bases. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 1995 VSV-New Jersey belongs to a lineage distinct from that of the 1982 to 1985 viruses that caused previous outbreaks in the western United States. Furthermore, it also is distinct from strains from Central America and from the Georgian Hazelhurst strain.},

title = {Refined annotation of the Arabidopsis genome by complete expressed sequence tag mapping},
abstract = {Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) currently encompass more entries in the public databases than any other form of sequence data. Thus, EST data sets provide a vast resource for gene identification and expression profiling. We have mapped the complete set of 176,915 publicly available Arabidopsis EST sequences onto the Arabidopsis genome using GeneSeqer, a spliced alignment program incorporating sequence similarity and splice site scoring. About 96% of the available ESTs could be properly aligned with a genomic locus, with the remaining ESTs deriving from organelle genomes and non-Arabidopsis sources or displaying insufficient sequence quality for alignment.

title = {Super paramagnetic clustering of protein sequences},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detection of sequence homologues represents a challenging task that is important for the discovery of protein families and the reliable application of automatic annotation methods. The presence of domains in protein families of diverse function, inhomogeneity and different sizes of protein families create considerable difficulties for the application of published clustering methods. RESULTS: Our work analyses the Super Paramagnetic Clustering (SPC) and its extension, global SPC (gSPC) algorithm. These algorithms cluster input data based on a method that is analogous to the treatment of an inhomogeneous ferromagnet in physics. For the SwissProt and SCOP databases we show that the gSPC improves the specificity and sensitivity of clustering over the original SPC and Markov Cluster algorithm (TRIBE-MCL) up to 30%. The three algorithms provided similar results for the MIPS FunCat 1.3 annotation of four bacterial genomes, Bacillus subtilis, Helicobacter pylori, Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. However, the gSPC covered about 12% more sequences compared to the other methods. The SPC algorithm was programmed in house using C++ and it is available at http://mips.gsf.de/proj/spc. The FunCat annotation is available at http://mips.gsf.de. CONCLUSION: The gSPC calculated to a higher accuracy or covered a larger number of sequences than the TRIBE-MCL algorithm. Thus it is a useful approach for automatic detection of protein families and unsupervised annotation of full genomes.},

title = {Genetic diversity of enzootic isolates of vesicular stomatitis virus New Jersey},
abstract = {The RNA genomes of 43 vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) isolates of the New Jersey (NJ) serotype were T1-ribonuclease fingerprinted to compare the extent of genetic diversity of virus from regions of epizootic and enzootic disease activity. Forty of these viruses were obtained from Central America during 1982 to 1985. The other three were older isolates, including a 1970 isolate from Culex nigripalpus mosquitos in Guatemala, a 1960 bovine isolate from Panama, and a 1976 isolate from mosquitos (Mansonia indubitans) in Ecuador. The data indicate that extensive genetic diversity exists among virus isolates from this predominantly enzootic disease zone. Six distinct T1 fingerprint groups were identified for the Central American VSV NJ isolates from 1982 to 1985. The 1960 VSV NJ isolate from Panama and the 1976 isolate from Ecuador formed two additional distinct fingerprint groups. This finding is in sharp contrast to the relatively close genetic relationship existing among VSV NJ isolates obtained from predominantly epizootic disease areas of the United States and Mexico during the same period (S. T. Nichol, J. Virol. 61:1029-1036, 1987). In this previous study, RNA genome T1 fingerprint differences were observed among isolates from different epizootics; however, the isolates were all clearly members of one large T1 fingerprint group. The eight T1 fingerprint groups described here for Central American and Ecuadorian viruses are distinct from those characterized earlier for virus isolates from the United States and Mexico and for the common laboratory virus strains Ogden and Hazelhurst. Despite being isolated 14 years earlier, the 1970 insect isolate from Guatemala is clearly a member of one of the 1982 to 1985 Central American virus fingerprint groups. This indicates that although virus genetic diversity in the region is extensive, under certain natural conditions particular virus genotypes can be relatively stably maintained for an extended period. The implications of these findings for the evolution of VSV NJ and epizootiology of the disease are discussed.},

title = {The impact of recombination on nucleotide substitutions in the human genome},
abstract = {Unraveling the evolutionary forces responsible for variations of neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47%). This demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of GC-content. The evolution of GC-content correlates much more strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the neutral process of biased gene conversion (BGC) occurring within recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in the human genome. This model notably explains the positive correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate. Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore, recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots. This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions. We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and drift, BGC is one of the major factors driving genome evolution. Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density between human and chimp.},

abstract = {A full length cDNA copy of the NS mRNA of the Missouri strain (Hazelhurst subtype, New Jersey serotype) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been cloned and sequenced. The mRNA is 856 nucleotides long (excluding polyadenylic acid) and encodes a protein of 274 amino acids (mol. wt. 31 000). Comparison with the NS gene of the Ogden strain (Concan subtype, New Jersey serotype) showed 15% difference at the nucleotide level and 10% difference at the amino acid level; the majority of the changes were located in the 3' half of the mRNA. Comparison with the NS genes of two strains representing the Indiana serotype showed about 50% nucleotide and 33% amino acid sequence homology between the serotypes. In a four-way comparison of the proteins, two regions of higher homology were noted which may be of functional importance. Eighteen potential phosphorylation sites (Ser or Thr) were conserved between the four proteins; five of these sites correspond to the residues which have been suggested to be constitutively phosphorylated and may be essential for NS activity.},

title = {Unique features of nuclear mRNA poly(A) signals and alternative polyadenylation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii},
abstract = {To understand nuclear mRNA polyadenylation mechanisms in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we generated a data set of 16,952 in silico-verified poly(A) sites from EST sequencing traces based on Chlamydomonas Genome Assembly v.3.1. Analysis of this data set revealed a unique and complex polyadenylation signal profile that is setting Chlamydomonas apart from other organisms. In contrast to the high-AU content in the 3'-UTRs of other organisms, Chlamydomonas shows a high-guanylate content that transits to high-cytidylate around the poly(A) site. The average length of the 3'-UTR is 595 nucleotides (nt), significantly longer than that of Arabidopsis and rice. The dominant poly(A) signal, UGUAA, was found in 52% of the near-upstream elements, and its occurrence may be positively correlated with higher gene expression levels. The UGUAA signal also exists in Arabidopsis and in some mammalian genes but mainly in the far-upstream elements, suggesting a shift in function. The C-rich region after poly(A) sites with unique signal elements is a characteristic downstream element that is lacking in higher plants. We also found a high level of alternative polyadenylation in the Chlamydomonas genome, with a range of up to 33% of the 4057 genes analyzed having at least two unique poly(A) sites and approximately 1% of these genes having poly(A) sites residing in predicted coding sequences, introns, and 5'-UTRs. These potentially contribute to transcriptome diversity and gene expression regulation.},

Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) are a technology used to explore the transcriptome (a record of this gene activity). ESTs are short fragments of DNA created in the laboratory from mRNA extracted from a cell.  The key computational step in their processing is clustering: putting all ESTs associated from the same RNA together. Accurate clustering is quadratic in time in average EST length and number of ESTs, which makes na¨ıve algorithms infeasible for real data sets.

WABA was used to align 8 million bases of Caenorhabditis briggsae genomic DNA against the entire 97-million-base Caenorhabditis elegans genome. The alignment, including C. briggsae homologs of 154 genetically characterized C. elegans genes and many times this number of largely uncharacterized ORFs, can be browsed and searched on the Web (http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/ approximately kent/intronerator). The alignment confirms that patterns of conservation can be useful in identifying regulatory regions and rarely expressed coding regions. Conserved regulatory elements can be identified inside coding exons by examining the level of divergence at the wobble position of codons. The alignment reveals a bimodal size distribution of syntenic regions. Over 250 introns are present in one species but not the other. The 3' and 5' intron splice sites have more similarity to each other in introns unique to one species than in C. elegans introns as a whole, suggesting a possible mechanism for intron removal.},

title = {Exponential decay of GC content detected by strand-symmetric substitution rates influences the evolution of isochore structure},
abstract = {The distribution of guanine and cytosine nucleotides throughout a genome, or the GC content, is associated with numerous features in mammals; understanding the pattern and evolutionary history of GC content is crucial to our efforts to annotate the genome. The local GC content is decaying toward an equilibrium point, but the causes and rates of this decay, as well as the value of the equilibrium point, remain topics of debate. By comparing the results of 2 methods for estimating local substitution rates, we identify 620 Mb of the human genome in which the rates of the various types of nucleotide substitutions are the same on both strands. These strand-symmetric regions show an exponential decay of local GC content at a pace determined by local substitution rates. DNA segments subjected to higher rates experience disproportionately accelerated decay and are AT rich, whereas segments subjected to lower rates decay more slowly and are GC rich. Although we are unable to draw any conclusions about causal factors, the results support the hypothesis proposed by Khelifi A, Meunier J, Duret L, and Mouchiroud D (2006. GC content evolution of the human and mouse genomes: insights from the study of processed pseudogenes in regions of different recombination rates. J Mol Evol. 62:745-752.) that the isochore structure has been reshaped over time. If rate variation were a determining factor, then the current isochore structure of mammalian genomes could result from the local differences in substitution rates. We predict that under current conditions strand-symmetric portions of the human genome will stabilize at an average GC content of 30% (considerably less than the current 42%), thus confirming that the human genome has not yet reached equilibrium.},

However, it is not clear how fast these location-dependent rates change, or to what extent the substitution rate patterns are conserved between lineages. To address this question, which is critical not only for understanding the substitution process but also for evaluating phylogenetic footprinting algorithms, we examine ancestral repeats: a predominantly neutral dataset with a significantly higher genomic density than other datasets commonly used to study substitution rate variation. Using this repeat data, we measure the extent to which orthologous ancestral repeat sequences exhibit similar substitution patterns in separate mammalian lineages, allowing us to ascertain how well local substitution rates have been preserved across species. RESULTS: We calculated substitution rates for each ancestral repeat in each of three independent mammalian lineages (primate - from human/macaque alignments, rodent - from mouse/rat alignments, and laurasiatheria - from dog/cow alignments). We then measured the correlation of local substitution rates among these lineages. Overall we found the correlations between lineages to be statistically significant, but too weak to have much predictive power (r2 <5%). These correlations were found to be primarily driven by regional effects at the scale of several hundred kb or larger. A few repeat classes (e.g. 7SK, Charlie8, and MER121) also exhibited stronger conservation of rate patterns, likely due to the effect of repeat-specific purifying selection. These classes should be excluded when estimating local neutral substitution rates. CONCLUSION: Although local neutral substitution rates have some correlations among mammalian species, these correlations have little predictive power on the scale of individual repeats. This indicates that local substitution rates have changed significantly among the lineages we have studied, and are likely to have changed even more for more diverged lineages. The correlations that do persist are too weak to be responsible for many of the highly conserved elements found by phylogenetic footprinting algorithms, leading us to conclude that such elements must be conserved due to selective forces.},

title = {Breakpoint regions and homologous synteny blocks in chromosomes have different evolutionary histories},
abstract = {The persistence of large blocks of homologous synteny and a high frequency of breakpoint reuse are distinctive features of mammalian chromosomes that are not well understood in evolutionary terms. To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary forces that affect genome architecture, synteny relationships among 10 amniotes (human, chimp, macaque, rat, mouse, pig, cattle, dog, opossum, and chicken) were compared at <1 human-Mbp resolution. Homologous synteny blocks (HSBs; N = 2233) and chromosome evolutionary breakpoint regions (EBRs; N = 1064) were identified from pairwise comparisons of all genomes. Analysis of the size distribution of HSBs shared in all 10 species' chromosomes (msHSBs) identified three (>20 Mbp) that are larger than expected by chance. Gene network analysis of msHSBs >3 human-Mbp and EBRs <1 Mbp demonstrated that msHSBs are significantly enriched for genes involved in development of the central nervous and other organ systems, whereas EBRs are enriched for genes associated with adaptive functions. In addition, we found EBRs are significantly enriched for structural variations (segmental duplications, copy number variants, and indels), retrotransposed and zinc finger genes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms. These results demonstrate that chromosome breakage in evolution is nonrandom and that HSBs and EBRs are evolving in distinctly different ways. We suggest that natural selection acts on the genome to maintain combinations of genes and their regulatory elements that are essential to fundamental processes of amniote development and biological organization. Furthermore, EBRs may be used extensively to generate new genetic variation and novel combinations of genes and regulatory elements that contribute to adaptive phenotypes.},

De novo computational identification and classification of such elements is a challenging problem. Therefore, repeat annotation of sequenced genomes has historically largely relied on sequence similarity to hand-curated libraries of known repeat families. We present a new approach to de novo repeat annotation that exploits characteristic patterns of local alignments induced by certain classes of repeats. We describe PILER, a package of efficient search algorithms for identifying such patterns. Novel repeats found using PILER are reported for Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thalania and Drosophila melanogaster. AVAILABILITY: The PILER software is freely available at http://www.drive5.com/piler.},

abstract = {Today's biology educators face the challenge of training their students in modern molecular biology techniques including genomics and bioinformatics. The Dolan DNA Learning Center (DNALC) of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has developed and disseminated a bench- and computer-based plant genomics curriculum for biology faculty. In 2007, a five-day "Plant Genomics and Gene Annotation" workshop was held at Florida A{\&}M University in Tallahassee, FL, to enhance participants' knowledge and understanding of plant molecular genetics and assist them in developing and honing their laboratory and computer skills. Florida A{\&}M University is a historically black university with over 95% African-American student enrollment. Sixteen participants, including high school (56%) and community college faculty (25%), attended the workshop. Participants carried out in vitro and in silico experiments with maize, Arabidopsis, soybean, and food products to determine the genotype of the samples. Benefits of the workshop included increased awareness of plant biology research for high school and college level students. Participants completed pre- and postworkshop evaluations for the measurement of effectiveness. Participants demonstrated an overall improvement in their postworkshop evaluation scores. This article provides a detailed description of workshop activities, as well as assessment and long-term support for broad classroom implementation.},

Here we describe a genome-wide effort, carried out as part of the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project, to identify human genes not yet in the gene catalogs. Our approach was to produce gene predictions by algorithms that rely on comparative sequence data but do not require direct cDNA evidence, then to test predicted novel genes by RT-PCR. We have identified 734 novel gene fragments (NGFs) containing 2188 exons with, at most, weak prior cDNA support. These NGFs correspond to an estimated 563 distinct genes, of which >160 are completely absent from the major gene catalogs, while hundreds of others represent significant extensions of known genes. The NGFs appear to be predominantly protein-coding genes rather than noncoding RNAs, unlike novel transcribed sequences identified by technologies such as tiling arrays and CAGE. They tend to be expressed at low levels and in a tissue-specific manner, and they are enriched for roles in motor activity, cell adhesion, connective tissue, and central nervous system development. Our results demonstrate that many important genes and gene fragments have been missed by traditional approaches to gene discovery but can be identified by their evolutionary signatures using comparative sequence data. However, they suggest that hundreds-not thousands-of protein-coding genes are completely missing from the current gene catalogs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has recently been shown that levels of diversity in mitochondrial DNA are remarkably constant across animals of diverse census population sizes and ecologies, which has led to the suggestion that the effective population of mitochondrial DNA may be relatively constant. RESULTS: Here we present several lines of evidence that suggest, to the contrary, that the effective population size of mtDNA does vary, and that the variation can be substantial. First, we show that levels of mitochondrial and nuclear diversity are correlated within all groups of animals we surveyed. Second, we show that the effectiveness of selection on non-synonymous mutations, as measured by the ratio of the numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous polymorphisms, is negatively correlated to levels of mitochondrial diversity. Finally, we estimate the effective population size of mitochondrial DNA in selected mammalian groups and show that it varies by at least an order of magnitude. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is variation in the effective population size of mitochondria. Furthermore we suggest that the relative constancy of DNA diversity may be due to a negative correlation between the effective population size and the mutation rate per generation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The recent release of the draft sequence of the chimpanzee genome is an invaluable resource for finding genome-wide genetic differences that might explain phenotypic differences between humans and chimpanzees. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe a simple procedure to identify potential human-specific frameshift mutations that occurred after the divergence of human and chimpanzee. The procedure involves collecting human coding exons bearing insertions or deletions compared with the chimpanzee genome and identification of homologs from other species, in support of the mutations being human-specific. Using this procedure, we identified nine genes, BASE, DNAJB3, FLJ33674, HEJ1, NTSR2, RPL13AP, SCGB1D4, WBSCR27 and ZCCHC13, that show human-specific alterations including truncations of the C-terminus. In some cases, the frameshift mutation results in gene inactivation or decay. In other cases, the altered protein seems to be functional. This study demonstrates that even the unfinished chimpanzee genome sequence can be useful in identifying modification of genes that are specific to the human lineage and, therefore, could potentially be relevant to the study of the acquisition of human-specific traits.

title = {Quantifying the stationarity and time reversibility of the nucleotide substitution process},
abstract = {Markov models describing the evolution of the nucleotide substitution process, widely used in phylogeny reconstruction, usually assume the hypotheses of stationarity and time reversibility. Although these models give meaningful results when applied to biological data, it is not clear if the 2 assumptions mentioned above hold and, if not, how much sequence evolution processes deviate from them. To this aim, we introduce 2 sets of indices that can be calculated from the nucleotide distribution and the substitution rates. The stationarity indices (STIs) can be used to test the validity of the equilibrium assumption. The irreversibility indices (IRIs) are derived from the Kolmogorov cycle conditions for time reversibility and quantify the degree of nontime reversibility of a process. We have computed STIs and IRIs for the evolutionary process of 2 lineages, Drosophila simulans and Homo sapiens. In the latter case, we use a modified form of the indices that takes into account the CpG decay process. In both cases, we find statistically significant deviations from the ideal case of a process that has reached stationarity and is time reversible.},

title = {Glycoprotein evolution of vesicular stomatitis virus New Jersey},
abstract = {A T1 ribonuclease fingerprinting study of a large number of virus isolates had previously demonstrated that considerable genetic variability existed among natural isolates of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) New Jersey (NJ) serotype [S.T. Nichol (1988) J. Virol. 62, 572-579]. Based on these results, 34 virus isolates were chosen as representing the extent of genetic diversity within the VSV NJ serotype. We report the entire glycoprotein (G) gene nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence for each of these viruses. Up to 19.8% G gene sequence differences could be seen among NJ serotype isolates. Analysis of the distribution of nucleotide substitutions relative to nucleotide codon position revealed that third position changes were distributed randomly throughout the gene. Third base changes constituted 84% of the observed nucleotide substitutions and affected 89% of the third base positions located in the G gene. Only three short oligonucleotide stretches of complete sequence conservation were observed. The remaining nucleotide changes located in the first and second positions were not distributed randomly, indicating that most of the amino acids coded by the G gene cannot be altered without reducing the fitness of the VSV NJ serotype viruses. Despite these constraints, up to 8.5% amino acid differences were observed between virus isolates. These differences were located throughout the G protein including regions adjacent to defined major antibody neutralization epitopes. Apparent clusters of amino acid substitutions were present in the hydrophobic signal sequence, transmembrane domain, and within the cytoplasmic domain of the G protein. A maximum parsimony analysis of the G gene nucleotide sequences allowed construction of a phylogram indicating the evolutionary relationship of these viruses. The VSV NJ serotype appears to contain at least three distinct lineages or subtypes. All recent virus isolates from the United States and Mexico are within subtype I and appear to have evolved from an ancestor more closely related to the Hazelhurst historic strain than other older strains. The implications of these findings for the evolution, epizootiology, and classification of these viruses are discussed.},

The CpG-methylation-deamination process is, e.g. a prominent process in vertebrates (CpG effect). Such processes, often with unknown mechanistic origins, need to be incorporated into realistic models of nucleotide substitutions. RESULTS: Based on a general framework of nucleotide substitutions we developed a method that is able to identify the most relevant neighbor-dependent substitution processes, estimate their relative frequencies and judge their importance in order to be included into the modeling. Starting from a model for neighbor independent nucleotide substitution we successively added neighbor-dependent substitution processes in the order of their ability to increase the likelihood of the model describing given data. The analysis of neighbor-dependent nucleotide substitutions based on repetitive elements found in the genomes of human, zebrafish and fruit fly is presented.

title = {Efficient clustering of large EST data sets on parallel computers},
abstract = {Clustering expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is a powerful strategy for gene identification, gene expression studies and identifying important genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms. To enable fast clustering of large-scale EST data, we developed PaCE (for Parallel Clustering of ESTs), a software program for EST clustering on parallel computers. In this paper, we report on the design and development of PaCE and its evaluation using Arabidopsis ESTs. The novel features of our approach include: (i) design of memory efficient algorithms to reduce the memory required to linear in the size of the input, (ii) a combination of algorithmic techniques to reduce the computational work without sacrificing the quality of clustering, and (iii) use of parallel processing to reduce run-time and facilitate clustering of larger data sets. Using a combination of these techniques, we report the clustering of 168 200 Arabidopsis ESTs in 15 min on an IBM xSeries cluster with 30 dual-processor nodes. We also clustered 327 632 rat ESTs in 47 min and 420 694 Triticum aestivum ESTs in 3 h and 15 min. We demonstrate the quality of our software using benchmark Arabidopsis EST data, and by comparing it with CAP3, a software widely used for EST assembly. Our software allows clustering of much larger EST data sets than is possible with current software. Because of its speed, it also facilitates multiple runs with different parameters, providing biologists a tool to better analyze EST sequence data. Using PaCE, we clustered EST data from 23 plant species and the results are available at the PlantGDB website.},

title = {Interferon induction by viruses. XVIII. Vesicular stomatitis virus-New Jersey: a single infectious particle can both induce and suppress interferon production},
abstract = {In contrast to wild-type vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) of Indiana (Ind.) origin which express interferon (IFN) inducing- and IFN induction-suppressing activities as mutually exclusive properties, individual particles of wild-type VSV of the New Jersey (N.J.) serotype (Hazelhurst [H] isolate) paradoxically can both induce IFN and suppress its induction in cells coinfected with a potent inducer of IFN. The properties of IFN induction, and its suppression, appear to reside in the particle that manifests infectivity. Analyses of IFN induction dose-response curves to measure IFN-inducing particles (IFP), and IFN yield-reduction curves to measure IFN induction-suppressing particles (ISP) generated by VSV-N.J.(H) in aged chick embryo cells revealed that (i) a single particle per cell sufficed to induce a quantum (full) yield of IFN, or to suppress fully IFN production by a coinfecting inducing virus, and (ii) the addition of one or more IFP per cell did not suppress the yield of IFN beyond the plateau level. The time-course of IFN production in chick cells infected with VSV-N.J. (H) revealed about a 4-h lag, even when the cells were coinfected with a potent inducer that normally induced IFN 1 or 2 h sooner. Thus, VSV-N.J.(H) appears to regulate the production of IFN in cells--even that initiated by other inducers. Expression of IFP and ISP activities both required primary transcription, with respective genomic targets similar to those reported for VSV-Ind. N.J.(H) is the first wild-type VSV observed to express IFP and ISP activities concomitantly. A model is presented to suggest how these two antagonistic properties might be expressed by a single infectious particle.},

Pseudogenes are important resources in understanding the evolutionary history of genes and genomes. RESULTS: We have developed a homology-based computational pipeline ('PseudoPipe') that can search a mammalian genome and identify pseudogene sequences in a comprehensive and consistent manner. The key steps in the pipeline involve using BLAST to rapidly cross-reference potential "parent" proteins against the intergenic regions of the genome and then processing the resulting "raw hits" -- i.e. eliminating redundant ones, clustering together neighbors, and associating and aligning clusters with a unique parent. Finally, pseudogenes are classified based on a combination of criteria including homology, intron-exon structure, and existence of stop codons and frameshifts.},

This program can efficiently cluster a huge protein database with millions of sequences. However, the applications of the underlying algorithm are not limited to only protein sequences clustering, here we present several new programs using the same algorithm including cd-hit-2d, cd-hit-est and cd-hit-est-2d. Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a DNA/RNA sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as BLAST.},

abstract = {Approximately 185,000 Gossypium EST sequences comprising >94,800,000 nucleotides were amassed from 30 cDNA libraries constructed from a variety of tissues and organs under a range of conditions, including drought stress and pathogen challenges. These libraries were derived from allopolyploid cotton (Gossypium hirsutum; A(T) and D(T) genomes) as well as its two diploid progenitors, Gossypium arboreum (A genome) and Gossypium raimondii (D genome). ESTs were assembled using the Program for Assembling and Viewing ESTs (PAVE), resulting in 22,030 contigs and 29,077 singletons (51,107 unigenes). Further comparisons among the singletons and contigs led to recognition of 33,665 exemplar sequences that represent a nonredundant set of putative Gossypium genes containing partial or full-length coding regions and usually one or two UTRs. The assembly, along with their UniProt BLASTX hits, GO annotation, and Pfam analysis results, are freely accessible as a public resource for cotton genomics. Because ESTs from diploid and allotetraploid Gossypium were combined in a single assembly, we were in many cases able to bioinformatically distinguish duplicated genes in allotetraploid cotton and assign them to either the A or D genome. The assembly and associated information provide a framework for future investigation of cotton functional and evolutionary genomics.},

abstract = {Persistence of vesicular stomatitis virus New Jersey (VSV-NJ) was studied in experimentally infected hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We used reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-NPCR) to probe tissues of hamsters inoculated with VSV-NJ Hazelhurst. Viral genomic RNA was detected in the brain, cerebellum, spleen, liver, kidney, and lung 2 months after infection, but only in the central nervous system at 10 and 12 months. Viral messenger RNA was detected in the brain of one hamster at 2 months after infection. Replicative intermediate was detected in the spinal cord of one hamster at 12 months. These results suggest that VSV-RNA persists in animals for long periods following infection, disease, and convalescence. However, infectious virus was not recovered from tissues by conventional serial passages of tissue extracts in Vero cells or by cocultivation.},

abstract = {The 5'-terminal sequence of VSV(NJ) (Ogden) and VSV(NJ) (Hazelhurst) was compared in an attempt to understand why the defective interfering particle, DI-LT, heterotypically interferes with VSV(NJ) (Ogden) but not with VSV(NJ) (Hazelhurst). The 5'-terminal sequence of VSV(NJ) (Ogden) genomic RNA was determined by direct RNA sequencing and by DNA sequencing of cDNA clones of the 3'-terminal sequence of VSV(NJ) (Ogden) DI particle genome. Primer extension analysis of the 5'-terminus of VSV(NJ) (Ogden) standard genomic RNA confirmed these data. Within the last 47 nucleotides, equivalent to the negative-strand leader RNA, the only nucleotide changes between VSV(NJ) (Ogden) and VSV(NJ) (Hazelhurst) occur between nucleotides 19 and 26, representing part of the putative NS binding region described by Isaac and Keene (J. Virol. 43, 241-249 (1982] for VSV(IND) DI particles. The spacer (S) region, located between the polyadenylation signal of the L gene and the 47th nucleotide of the leader RNA, contains more differences. The polyadenylation signal of the L gene is fully conserved, but the remainder of the L gene region (177 nucleotides) has highly diverged between VSV(NJ) (Ogden) and VSV(NJ) (Hazelhurst). The changes in the NS binding region of the negative-strand leader RNA provide further evidence for the divergent evolution of VSV(NJ) (Ogden) and VSV(NJ) (Hazelhurst). The NS binding region has been implicated as a crucial site for the initiation of RNA transcription and replication. The interaction of the NS protein with this site may determine the ability of DI particles to interfere heterotypically.},

abstract = {DNA methylation has two essential roles in plants and animals - defending the genome against transposons and regulating gene expression. Recent experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana have begun to address crucial questions about how DNA methylation is established and maintained. One cardinal insight has been the discovery that DNA methylation can be guided by small RNAs produced through RNA-interference pathways. Plants and mammals use a similar suite of DNA methyltransferases to propagate DNA methylation, but plants have also developed a glycosylase-based mechanism for removing DNA methylation, and there are hints that similar processes function in other organisms.},

title = {Design optimization methods for genomic DNA tiling arrays},
abstract = {A recent development in microarray research entails the unbiased coverage, or tiling, of genomic DNA for the large-scale identification of transcribed sequences and regulatory elements. A central issue in designing tiling arrays is that of arriving at a single-copy tile path, as significant sequence cross-hybridization can result from the presence of non-unique probes on the array. Due to the fragmentation of genomic DNA caused by the widespread distribution of repetitive elements, the problem of obtaining adequate sequence coverage increases with the sizes of subsequence tiles that are to be included in the design. This becomes increasingly problematic when considering complex eukaryotic genomes that contain many thousands of interspersed repeats. The general problem of sequence tiling can be framed as finding an optimal partitioning of non-repetitive subsequences over a prescribed range of tile sizes, on a DNA sequence comprising repetitive and non-repetitive regions. Exact solutions to the tiling problem become computationally infeasible when applied to large genomes, but successive optimizations are developed that allow their practical implementation. These include an efficient method for determining the degree of similarity of many oligonucleotide sequences over large genomes, and two algorithms for finding an optimal tile path composed of longer sequence tiles. The first algorithm, a dynamic programming approach, finds an optimal tiling in linear time and space; the second applies a heuristic search to reduce the space complexity to a constant requirement. A Web resource has also been developed, accessible at http://tiling.gersteinlab.org, to generate optimal tile paths from user-provided DNA sequences.},

However, the cDNA clones expressing functional L proteins of the VSV(NJ) serotype were not available. It was necessary to obtain functional clones of the New Jersey serotype of VSV (VSV(NJ)) in order to study homologous viral interference. Here we report the cDNA cloning, expression, and functional analyses of L proteins from both the Hazelhurst subtype and Concan subtype of VSV(NJ). The analysis of the expressed L proteins for the transcription and replication of VSV demonstrate that both VSV(NJ) L clones express functional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.},

abstract = {Several new families of DNA transposons were identified by computer-assisted searches in a wide range of animal species that includes nematodes, flat worms, mosquitoes, sea squirt, zebrafish, and humans. Many of these elements have coding capacity for transposases, which are related to each other and to those encoded by the IS1016 group of bacterial insertion sequences. Although these transposases display a motif similar to the DDE motif found in many transposases and integrases, they cannot be directly allied to any of the previously described eukaryotic transposases. Other common features of the new eukaryotic and bacterial transposons include similarities in their terminal inverted repeats and 8-bp or 9-bp target-site duplications. Together, these data indicate that these elements belong to a new superfamily of DNA transposons, called Merlin/IS1016, which is common in many eubacterial and animal genomes. We also present evidence that these transposons have been recently active in several animal species. This evidence is particularly strong in the parasitic blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, in which Merlin is also the first described DNA transposon family.},

abstract = {To investigate the role that defective interfering (DI) particles might conceivably play in the epizootiology of vesicular stomatitis, two virulent New Jersey (NJ) isolates from the 1982-1983 epizootic in the United States (US) were compared with three laboratory adapted strains of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV): NJ Hazelhurst, NJ Ogden and Indiana San Juan. Successive undiluted passages showed that the virulent isolates did not readily exhibit 'autointerference' because they did not readily generate and amplify DI particles. Viral RNA synthesis of isolates that were exposed to homotypic or heterotypic DI particles generated from the laboratory strains showed that the isolates were totally resistant to the heterotypic DI particle and partially resistant to the homotypic DI particle. In contrast, Indiana San Juan and NJ Ogden were inhibited by hetero- or homotypic DI particles. NJ Hazelhurst more closely resembled the isolates. This demonstrates that virulence of VSV in its natural setting may be related to a number of factors, including the slower generation and amplification of endogenous DI particles, as well as the increased resistance of the virus to some pre-existing DI particles.},

abstract = {Defective interfering (DI) particles have been isolated from a heat-resistant strain of the New Jersey (Ogden) serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Most of these DI particles contain various portions of all five cistrons of VSV. The two largest DI particles, NJ-121 and NJ-PG2, represent approximately 60% of the standard virus genome and contain both the positive and negative strand leader RNA templates. These two DI particles are transcriptionally active and synthesize both the positive and negative strand leader RNAs in vitro. Virion RNA probe-mRNA hybridizations and cDNA probe-virion RNA hybridizations have shown that NJ-121 contains mainly sequences from the L and G genes. In contrast, NJ-PG2 has portions of the sequences from all five genes of VSV. Smaller DI particles, NJ-121a, NJ-121b, NJ-PG1, and NJ-JM2 representing approximately 50, 38, 28, and 25% of the standard virus genome respectively, were also generated. These DI particles did not have sequences complementary to the positive strand leader RNA template. The mRNA hybridization patterns and results of the genomic RNAs hybridizing to cDNAs of N, NS, M, and G genes of these DI particles showed that they contain parts of information from all five cistrons. Most of the DI particles appear to be generated by multiple deletions throughout the standard virus genome. None of these DI particles interfered heterotypically with VSVIND-HR in BHK21, R(B77), or L2 cells. However, they interfered well with infection by VSVNJ (Hazelhurst).},

abstract = {Divergence of gene expression can result in phenotypic variation, which contributes to the evolution of new species. Although the influence of trans- and cis-regulatory mutations is well known, the genome-wide impact of changes in genomic neighborhood of genes on expression divergence between species remains largely unexplored. Here, we compare the neighborhood of orthologous genes (within a window of 2 MB) in human and chimpanzee with the expression levels of their transcripts from several equivalent tissues and demonstrate that genes with altered neighborhood are more likely to undergo expression divergence than genes with conserved neighborhood. We observe the same trend when expression divergence data were analyzed from six different brain parts that are equivalent between human and chimpanzee. Additionally, we find enrichment for genes with altered neighborhood to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the human brain. These results suggest that expression divergence induced by this mechanism could have contributed to the phenotypic differences between human and chimpanzee. We propose that, in addition to other molecular mechanisms, change in genomic neighborhood is an important factor that drives transcriptome evolution.},

title = {Identifying novel transcripts and novel genes in the human genome by using novel SAGE tags},
abstract = {The number of genes in the human genome is still a controversial issue. Whereas most of the genes in the human genome are said to have been physically or computationally identified, many short cDNA sequences identified as tags by use of serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) do not match these genes. By performing experimental verification of more than 1,000 SAGE tags and analyzing 4,285,923 SAGE tags of human origin in the current SAGE database, we examined the nature of the unmatched SAGE tags. Our study shows that most of the unmatched SAGE tags are truly novel SAGE tags that originated from novel transcripts not yet identified in the human genome, including alternatively spliced transcripts from known genes and potential novel genes. Our study indicates that by using novel SAGE tags as probes, we should be able to identify efficiently many novel transcripts/novel genes in the human genome that are difficult to identify by conventional methods.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing data from non-normalized samples offer unique opportunities to study the metabolic states of organisms. One can deduce gene expression levels using sequence coverage as a surrogate, identify coding changes or discover novel isoforms or transcripts. Especially for discovery of novel events, de novo assembly of transcriptomes is desirable. RESULTS: Transcriptome from tumor tissue of a patient with follicular lymphoma was sequenced with 36 base pair (bp) single- and paired-end reads on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform. We assembled approximately 194 million reads using ABySS into 66 921 contigs 100 bp or longer, with a maximum contig length of 10 951 bp, representing over 30 million base pairs of unique transcriptome sequence, or roughly 1% of the genome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and binaries of ABySS are freely available for download at http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/abyss. Assembler tool is implemented in C++. The parallel version uses Open MPI. ABySS-Explorer tool is implemented in Java using the Java universal network/graph framework. CONTACT: ibirol@bcgsc.ca.},

title = {Ubiquitous reassortments in influenza A viruses},
abstract = {The influenza A virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus composed of eight segmented RNA molecules, including polymerases (PB2, PB1, PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (MP), and nonstructure gene (NS). The influenza A viruses are notorious for rapid mutations, frequent reassortments, and possible recombinations. Among these evolutionary events, reassortments refer to exchanges of discrete RNA segments between co-infected influenza viruses, and they have facilitated the generation of pandemic and epidemic strains. Thus, identification of reassortments will be critical for pandemic and epidemic prevention and control. This paper presents a reassortment identification method based on distance measurement using complete composition vector (CCV) and segment clustering using a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. By applying this method, we identified 34 potential reassortment clusters among 2,641 PB2 segments of influenza A viruses. Among the 83 serotypes tested, at least 56 (67.46%) exchanged their fragments with another serotype of influenza A viruses. These identified reassortments involve 1,957 H2N1 and 1,968 H3N2 influenza pandemic strains as well as H5N1 avian influenza virus isolates, which have generated the potential for a future pandemic threat. More frequent reassortments were found to occur in wild birds, especially migratory birds. This MST clustering program is written in Java and will be available upon request.},

This analysis completes the entire genomic sequence of the VSVNJ (Ogden). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of this L protein with those reported for L proteins of Indiana serotype and Hazelhurst strain of New Jersey serotype revealed an extensive sequence similarity among all three proteins. The comparison was further extended to the L proteins of other nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, namely the rabies virus and four members of the paramyxovirus family: measles, Newcastle disease, human parainfluenza 3, and Sendai viruses. Our findings confirmed the existence of conserved as well as unique domains in the L proteins, suggesting an evolutionary relationship among these viruses.},

abstract = {Comprehensive understanding of functional elements in the human genome will require thorough interrogation and comparison of individual human genomes and genomic structures. Such an endeavor will require improvements in the throughputs and costs of DNA sequencing. Next-generation sequencing platforms have impressively low costs and high throughputs but are limited by short read lengths. An immediate and widely recognized solution to this critical limitation is the paired-end tag (PET) sequencing for various applications, collectively called the PET sequencing strategy, in which short and paired tags are extracted from the ends of long DNA fragments for ultra-high-throughput sequencing. The PET sequences can be accurately mapped to the reference genome, thus demarcating the genomic boundaries of PET-represented DNA fragments and revealing the identities of the target DNA elements. PET protocols have been developed for the analyses of transcriptomes, transcription factor binding sites, epigenetic sites such as histone modification sites, and genome structures. The exclusive advantage of the PET technology is its ability to uncover linkages between the two ends of DNA fragments. Using this unique feature, unconventional fusion transcripts, genome structural variations, and even molecular interactions between distant genomic elements can be unraveled by PET analysis. Extensive use of PET data could lead to efficient assembly of individual human genomes, transcriptomes, and interactomes, enabling new biological and clinical insights. With its versatile and powerful nature for DNA analysis, the PET sequencing strategy has a bright future ahead.},

abstract = {Human segmental duplications are hotspots for nonallelic homologous recombination leading to genomic disorders, copy-number polymorphisms and gene and transcript innovations. The complex structure and history of these regions have precluded a global evolutionary analysis. Combining a modified A-Bruijn graph algorithm with comparative genome sequence data, we identify the origin of 4,692 ancestral duplication loci and use these to cluster 437 complex duplication blocks into 24 distinct groups. The sequence-divergence data between ancestral-derivative pairs and a comparison with the chimpanzee and macaque genome support a 'punctuated' model of evolution. Our analysis reveals that human segmental duplications are frequently organized around 'core' duplicons, which are enriched for transcripts and, in some cases, encode primate-specific genes undergoing positive selection. We hypothesize that the rapid expansion and fixation of some intrachromosomal segmental duplications during great-ape evolution has been due to the selective advantage conferred by these genes and transcripts embedded within these core duplications.},

title = {Detection of transposable elements by their compositional bias},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transposable elements (TE) are mobile genetic entities present in nearly all genomes. Previous work has shown that TEs tend to have a different nucleotide composition than the host genes, either considering codon usage bias or dinucleotide frequencies. We show here how these compositional differences can be used as a tool for detection and analysis of TE sequences. RESULTS: We compared the composition of TE sequences and host gene sequences using probabilistic models of nucleotide sequences. We used hidden Markov models (HMM), which take into account the base composition of the sequences (occurrences of words n nucleotides long, with n ranging here from 1 to 4) and the heterogeneity between coding and non-coding parts of sequences. We analyzed three sets of sequences containing class I TEs, class II TEs and genes respectively in three species: Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana. Each of these sets had a distinct, homogeneous composition, enabling us to distinguish between the two classes of TE and the genes. However the particular base composition of the TEs differed in the three species studied. CONCLUSIONS: This approach can be used to detect and annotate TEs in genomic sequences and complements the current homology-based TE detection methods. Furthermore, the HMM method is able to identify the parts of a sequence in which the nucleotide composition resembles that of a coding region of a TE. This is useful for the detailed annotation of TE sequences, which may contain an ancient, highly diverged coding region that is no longer fully functional.},

title = {Emergence of primate genes by retrotransposon-mediated sequence transduction},
abstract = {Gene duplication is one of the most important mechanisms for creating new genes and generating genomic novelty. Retrotransposon-mediated sequence transduction (i.e., the process by which a retrotransposon carries flanking sequence during its mobilization) has been proposed as a gene duplication mechanism. L1 exon shuffling potential has been reported in cell culture assays, and two potential L1-mediated exon shuffling events have been identified in the genome. SVA is the youngest retrotransposon family in primates and is capable of 3' flanking sequence transduction during retrotransposition. In this study, we examined all of the full-length SVA elements in the human genome to assess the frequency and impact of SVA-mediated 3' sequence transduction. Our results showed that approximately 53 kb of genomic sequences have been duplicated by 143 different SVA-mediated transduction events. In particular, we identified one group of SVA elements that duplicated the entire AMAC gene three times in the human genome through SVA-mediated transduction events, which happened before the divergence of humans and African great apes. In addition to the original AMAC gene, the three transduced AMAC copies contain intact ORFs in the human genome, and at least two are actively transcribed in different human tissues. The duplication of entire genes and the creation of previously undescribed gene families through retrotransposon-mediated sequence transduction represent an important mechanism by which mobile elements impact their host genomes.},

abstract = {Stowaway is a superfamily of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) that is widespread and abundant in plant genomes. Like other MITEs, however, its origin and mode of amplification are poorly understood. Several lines of evidence point to plant mariner-like elements (MLEs) as the autonomous partners of the nonautonomous Stowaway MITEs. To better understand this relationship, we have taken advantage of the nearly complete genome sequences of two rice subspecies to generate the first inventory of virtually all MLEs and Stowaway families coexisting in a single plant species. Thirty-four different MLEs were found to group into three major clades and 25 families. More than 22,000 Stowaway MITEs were identified and classified into 36 families. On the basis of detailed sequence comparisons, MLEs were confirmed to be the best candidate autonomous elements for Stowaway MITEs. Surprisingly, however, sequence similarity between MLE and Stowaway families was restricted to the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and, in a few cases, to adjacent subterminal sequences. These data suggest a model whereby most of the Stowaway MITEs in rice were cross-mobilized by MLE transposases encoded by distantly related elements.},

title = {Adaptation of HIV-1 to human leukocyte antigen class I},
abstract = {The rapid and extensive spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic provides a rare opportunity to witness host-pathogen co-evolution involving humans. A focal point is the interaction between genes encoding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and those encoding HIV proteins. HLA molecules present fragments (epitopes) of HIV proteins on the surface of infected cells to enable immune recognition and killing by CD8(+) T cells; particular HLA molecules, such as HLA-B*57, HLA-B*27 and HLA-B*51, are more likely to mediate successful control of HIV infection. Mutation within these epitopes can allow viral escape from CD8(+) T-cell recognition. Here we analysed viral sequences and HLA alleles from >2,800 subjects, drawn from 9 distinct study cohorts spanning 5 continents. Initial analysis of the HLA-B*51-restricted epitope, TAFTIPSI (reverse transcriptase residues 128-135), showed a strong correlation between the frequency of the escape mutation I135X and HLA-B*51 prevalence in the 9 study cohorts (P = 0.0001). Extending these analyses to incorporate other well-defined CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, including those restricted by HLA-B*57 and HLA-B*27, showed that the frequency of these epitope variants (n = 14) was consistently correlated with the prevalence of the restricting HLA allele in the different cohorts (together, P < 0.0001), demonstrating strong evidence of HIV adaptation to HLA at a population level. This process of viral adaptation may dismantle the well-established HLA associations with control of HIV infection that are linked to the availability of key epitopes, and highlights the challenge for a vaccine to keep pace with the changing immunological landscape presented by HIV.},

title = {A probabilistic model of local sequence alignment that simplifies statistical significance estimation},
abstract = {Sequence database searches require accurate estimation of the statistical significance of scores. Optimal local sequence alignment scores follow Gumbel distributions, but determining an important parameter of the distribution (lambda) requires time-consuming computational simulation. Moreover, optimal alignment scores are less powerful than probabilistic scores that integrate over alignment uncertainty ("Forward" scores), but the expected distribution of Forward scores remains unknown. Here, I conjecture that both expected score distributions have simple, predictable forms when full probabilistic modeling methods are used. For a probabilistic model of local sequence alignment, optimal alignment bit scores ("Viterbi" scores) are Gumbel-distributed with constant lambda = log 2, and the high scoring tail of Forward scores is exponential with the same constant lambda. Simulation studies support these conjectures over a wide range of profile/sequence comparisons, using 9,318 profile-hidden Markov models from the Pfam database. This enables efficient and accurate determination of expectation values (E-values) for both Viterbi and Forward scores for probabilistic local alignments.},

title = {Gene losses during human origins},
abstract = {Pseudogenization is a widespread phenomenon in genome evolution, and it has been proposed to serve as an engine of evolutionary change, especially during human origins (the "less-is-more" hypothesis). However, there has been no comprehensive analysis of human-specific pseudogenes. Furthermore, it is unclear whether pseudogenization itself can be selectively favored and thus play an active role in human evolution. Here we conduct a comparative genomic analysis and a literature survey to identify 80 nonprocessed pseudogenes that were inactivated in the human lineage after its separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Many functions are involved among these genes, with chemoreception and immune response being outstandingly overrepresented, suggesting potential species-specific features in these aspects of human physiology. To explore the possibility of adaptive pseudogenization, we focus on CASPASE12, a cysteinyl aspartate proteinase participating in inflammatory and innate immune response to endotoxins. We provide population genetic evidence that the nearly complete fixation of a null allele at CASPASE12 has been driven by positive selection, probably because the null allele confers protection from severe sepsis. We estimate that the selective advantage of the null allele is about 0.9% and the pseudogenization started shortly before the out-of-Africa migration of modern humans. Interestingly, two other genes related to sepsis were also pseudogenized in humans, possibly by selection. These adaptive gene losses might have occurred because of changes in our environment or genetic background that altered the threat from or response to sepsis. The identification and analysis of human-specific pseudogenes open the door for understanding the roles of gene losses in human origins, and the demonstration that gene loss itself can be adaptive supports and extends the "less-is-more" hypothesis.},

abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic genomes that impact many aspects of genome function. TE detection in genomic sequences is typically performed using similarity searches against a set of reference sequences built from previously identified TEs. Here, we demonstrate that this process can be improved by designing reference sets that incorporate key aspects of the structure and evolution of TEs and by combining these sets with Repbase Update (RU), which is composed mainly of consensus sequences. Using the Arabidopsis genome as a test case, our approach leads to the detection of an extra 12.4% of TE sequences. These correspond to novel TE fragments as well as to the extension of TE fragments already detected by RU. Significantly, we find that TE detection could be readily optimized using only two reference sets, one containing true consensus sequences and the other mosaic sequences that capture the structural diversity of TE copies within a family.},

abstract = {The techniques that are usually used to detect transposable elements (TEs) in nucleic acid sequences rely on sequence similarity with previously characterized elements. However, these methods are likely to miss many elements in various organisms. We tested two strategies for the detection of unknown elements. The first, which we call "TBLASTX strategy," searches for TE sequences by comparing the six-frame translations of the nucleic acid sequences of known TEs with the genomic sequence of interest. The second, "repeat-based strategy," searches genomic sequences for long repeats and clusters them in groups of similar sequences. TE copies from a given family are expected to cluster together. We tested the Drosophila melanogaster genomic sequence and the recently sequenced Anopheles gambiae genome in which most TEs remain unknown. We showed that the "TBLASTX strategy" is very efficient as it detected at least 332 new TE families in D. melanogaster and 400 in A. gambiae. This was unexpected in Drosophila as TEs of this organism have been extensively studied. The "repeat-based strategy" appeared to be very inefficient because of two problems: (i) TE copies are heavily deleted and few copies share homologous regions, and (ii) segmental duplications are frequent and it is not easy to distinguish them from TE copies.},

Claims the first is a considerable better technique.  Problems related to the second:
1) Many deletions; few representations of any one portion
2) Inability to filter out TEs carried by a segmental duplication

Interesting points:
* Proposes that TEs are lost due to deletions, not sequence decay
* Deleting TEs could be a mechanism for controlling for genome size
* Certain TEs are more likely to be in segmental duplications -- causal effect? },

abstract = {Regional biases in substitution pattern are likely to be responsible for the large-scale variation in base composition observed in vertebrate genomes. However, the evolutionary forces responsible for these biases are still not clearly defined. In order to study the processes of mutation and fixation across the entire human genome, we analyzed patterns of substitution in Alu repeats since their insertion. We also studied patterns of human polymorphism within the repeats. There is a highly significant effect of recombination rate on the pattern of substitution, whereas no such effect is seen on the pattern of polymorphism. These results suggest that regional biases in substitution are caused by biased gene conversion, a process that increases the probability of fixation of mutations that increase GC content. Furthermore, the strongest correlate of substitution patterns is found to be male recombination rates rather than female or sex-averaged recombination rates. This indicates that in addition to sexual dimorphism in recombination rates, the sexes also differ in the relative rates of crossover and gene conversion.},

title = {Human-specific nonsense mutations identified by genome sequence comparisons},
abstract = {The comparative study of the human and chimpanzee genomes may shed light on the genetic ingredients for the evolution of the unique traits of humans. Here, we present a simple procedure to identify human-specific nonsense mutations that might have arisen since the human-chimpanzee divergence. The procedure involves collecting orthologous sequences in which a stop codon of the human sequence is aligned to a non-stop codon in the chimpanzee sequence and verifying that the latter is ancestral by finding homologs in other species without a stop codon. Using this procedure, we identify nine genes (CML2, FLJ14640, MT1L, NPPA, PDE3B, SERPINA13, TAP2, UIP1, and ZNF277) that would produce human-specific truncated proteins resulting in a loss or modification of the function. The premature terminations of CML2, MT1L, and SERPINA13 genes appear to abolish the original function of the encoded protein because the mutation removes a major part of the known active site in each case. The other six mutated genes are either known or presumed to produce functionally modified proteins. The mutations of five genes (CML2, FLJ14640, MT1L, NPPA, TAP2) are known or predicted to be polymorphic in humans. In these cases, the stop codon alleles are more prevalent than the ancestral allele, suggesting that the mutant alleles are approaching fixation since their emergence during the human evolution. The findings support the notion that functional modification or inactivation of genes by nonsense mutation is a part of the process of adaptive evolution and acquisition of species-specific features.},

Quantitative analyses specific for major allergenic components currently are being performed in numerous corporate and academic laboratories but have not been validated within or across laboratories in a systematic manner. In our laboratory, validation of double-bind (sandwich) ELISA assays for a diverse group of major allergens or extract components revealed a number of critical assay variables and reagent incubation conditions that directly influenced the precision, accuracy, specificity, and robustness of these tests. Data from ELISA methods for six allergens (Dermatophagoides farinae Der f 1, Alternaria Alt a 1, dog albumin, dog Can f 1, fire ant Sol i 3, and yellow jacket venom Ves 5) showed that up to twofold differences in results were observed when analysts or microplates were varied. Analyses of dog allergens using multiple reagents and concentrations indicated that twofold variations in results also can be produced by distinct combinations of materials or incubations from different assay steps. Data from Can f 1 and egg white analyses produced up to fivefold differences in antigen concentrations based on changes in the capture antibody source (mouse monoclonal versus rabbit polyclonal) or storage buffer. These results suggest that differences in major allergen concentrations reported by different testing laboratories may be related to assay differences as well as extract variations and raise questions as to the accuracy of major allergen concentrations and therapeutic dose recommendations reported at regional and national allergy meetings. Validated double-bind ELISA methods may be well suited for consistency monitoring and standardization of extracts provided that reference materials, reagent qualifications, and interlaboratory comparability are defined precisely.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: We present ExonHunter, a new and comprehensive gene finding system that outperforms existing systems and features several new ideas and approaches. Our system combines numerous sources of information (genomic sequences, expressed sequence tags and protein databases of related species) into a gene finder based on a hidden Markov model in a novel and systematic way. In our framework, various sources of information are expressed as partial probabilistic statements about positions in the sequence and their annotation. We then combine these into the final prediction via a quadratic programming method, which we show to be an extension of existing methods. Allowing only partial statements is key to our transparent handling of missing information and coping with the heterogeneous character of individual sources of information. In addition, we give a new method for modeling the length distribution of intergenic regions in hidden Markov models. RESULTS: On a commonly used test set, ExonHunter performs significantly better than the existing gene finders ROSETTA, SLAM and TWINSCAN, with more than two-thirds of genes predicted completely correctly.

title = {A measure of DNA sequence dissimilarity based on Mahalanobis distance between frequencies of words},
abstract = {A number of algorithms exist for searching genetic databases for biologically significant similarities in DNA sequences. Past research has shown that word-based search tools are computationally efficient and can find similarities or dissimilarities invisible to other algorithms like FASTA. We characterize a family of word-based dissimilarity measures that define distance between two sequences by simultaneously comparing the frequencies of all subsequences of n adjacent letters (i.e., n-words) in the two sequences. Applications to real data demonstrate that currently used word-based methods that rely on Euclidean distance can be significantly improved by using Mahalanobis distance, which accounts for both variances and covariances between frequencies of n-words. Furthermore, in those cases where Mahalanobis distance may be too difficult to compute, using standardized Euclidean distance, which only corrects for the variances of frequencies of n-words, still gives better performance than the Euclidean distance. Also, a simple way of combining distances obtained at different n-words is considered. The goal is to obtain a single measure of dissimilarity between two DNA sequences. The performance ranking of the preceding three distances still holds for their combined counterparts. All results obtained in this paper are applicable to amino acid sequences with minor modifications.},

title = {Under the genomic radar: the stealth model of Alu amplification},
abstract = {Alu elements are the most successful SINEs (Short INterspersed Elements) in primate genomes and have reached more than 1,000,000 copies in the human genome. The amplification of most Alu elements is thought to occur through a limited number of hyperactive "master" genes that produce a high number of copies during long evolutionary periods of time. However, the existence of long-lived, low-activity Alu lineages in the human genome suggests a more complex propagation mechanism. Using both computational and wet-bench approaches, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the AluYb lineage, one of the most active Alu lineages in the human genome. We show that the major AluYb lineage expansion in humans is a species-specific event, as nonhuman primates possess only a handful of AluYb elements. However, the oldest existing AluYb element resided in an orthologous position in all hominoid primate genomes examined, demonstrating that the AluYb lineage originated 18-25 million years ago. Thus, the history of the AluYb lineage is characterized by approximately 20 million years of retrotranspositional quiescence preceding a major expansion in the human genome within the past few million years. We suggest that the evolutionary success of the Alu family may be driven at least in part by "stealth-driver" elements that maintain low retrotranspositional activity over extended periods of time and occasionally produce short-lived hyperactive copies responsible for the formation and remarkable expansion of Alu elements within the genome.},

title = {Optimization based automated curation of metabolic reconstructions},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, there exists tens of different microbial and eukaryotic metabolic reconstructions (e.g., Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis) with many more under development. All of these reconstructions are inherently incomplete with some functionalities missing due to the lack of experimental and/or homology information. A key challenge in the automated generation of genome-scale reconstructions is the elucidation of these gaps and the subsequent generation of hypotheses to bridge them. RESULTS: In this work, an optimization based procedure is proposed to identify and eliminate network gaps in these reconstructions. First we identify the metabolites in the metabolic network reconstruction which cannot be produced under any uptake conditions and subsequently we identify the reactions from a customized multi-organism database that restores the connectivity of these metabolites to the parent network using four mechanisms. This connectivity restoration is hypothesized to take place through four mechanisms: a) reversing the directionality of one or more reactions in the existing model, b) adding reaction from another organism to provide functionality absent in the existing model, c) adding external transport mechanisms to allow for importation of metabolites in the existing model and d) restore flow by adding intracellular transport reactions in multi-compartment models. We demonstrate this procedure for the genome- scale reconstruction of Escherichia coli and also Saccharomyces cerevisiae wherein compartmentalization of intra-cellular reactions results in a more complex topology of the metabolic network. We determine that about 10% of metabolites in E. coli and 30% of metabolites in S. cerevisiae cannot carry any flux. Interestingly, the dominant flow restoration mechanism is directionality reversals of existing reactions in the respective models. CONCLUSION: We have proposed systematic methods to identify and fill gaps in genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. The identified gaps can be filled both by making modifications in the existing model and by adding missing reactions by reconciling multi-organism databases of reactions with existing genome-scale models. Computational results provide a list of hypotheses to be queried further and tested experimentally.},

A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

abstract = {Analysis of the genome-wide patterns of single-nucleotide substitution reveals that the human GC content structure is out of equilibrium. The substitutions are decreasing the overall GC content (GC), at the same time making its range narrower. Investigation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that presently the decrease in GC content is due to a uniform mutational preference for A:T pairs, while its projected range is due to a variability in the fixation preference for G:C pairs. However, it is important to determine whether lessons learned about evolutionary processes operating at the present time (that is reflected in the SNP data) can be extended back into the evolutionary past. We describe here a new approach to this problem that utilizes the juxtaposition of forward and reverse substitution rates to determine the relative importance of variability in mutation rates and fixation probabilities in shaping long-term substitutional patterns. We use this approach to demonstrate that the forces shaping GC content structure over the recent past (since the appearance of the SNPs) extend all the way back to the mammalian radiation approximately 90 million years ago. In addition, we find a small but significant effect that has not been detected in the SNP data-relatively high rates of C:G-->A:T germline mutation in low-GC regions of the genome.},

title = {Designing multiple simultaneous seeds for DNA similarity search},
abstract = {The challenge of similarity search in massive DNA sequence databases has inspired major changes in BLAST-style alignment tools, which accelerate search by inspecting only pairs of sequences sharing a common short "seed," or pattern of matching residues. Some of these changes raise the possibility of improving search performance by probing sequence pairs with several distinct seeds, any one of which is sufficient for a seed match. However, designing a set of seeds to maximize their combined sensitivity to biologically meaningful sequence alignments is computationally difficult, even given recent advances in designing single seeds. This work describes algorithmic improvements to seed design that address the problem of designing a set of n seeds to be used simultaneously. We give a new local search method to optimize the sensitivity of seed sets. The method relies on efficient incremental computation of the probability that an alignment contains a match to a seed pi, given that it has already failed to match any of the seeds in a set Pi. We demonstrate experimentally that multi-seed designs, even with relatively few seeds, can be significantly more sensitive than even optimized single-seed designs.},

abstract = {We present PEACE, a stand-alone tool for high-throughput ab initio clustering of transcript fragment sequences produced by Next Generation or Sanger Sequencing technologies. It is freely available from www.peace-tools.org. Installed and managed through a downloadable user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), PEACE can process large data sets of transcript fragments of length 50 bases or greater, grouping the fragments by gene associations with a sensitivity comparable to leading clustering tools. Once clustered, the user can employ the GUI's analysis functions, facilitating the easy collection of statistics and allowing them to single out specific clusters for more comprehensive study or assembly. Using a novel minimum spanning tree-based clustering method, PEACE is the equal of leading tools in the literature, with an interface making it accessible to any user. It produces results of quality virtually identical to those of the WCD tool when applied to Sanger sequences, significantly improved results over WCD and TGICL when applied to the products of Next Generation Sequencing Technology and significantly improved results over Cap3 in both cases. In short, PEACE provides an intuitive GUI and a feature-rich, parallel clustering engine that proves to be a valuable addition to the leading cDNA clustering tools.},

However, several features including the C + G dependence and the CpG-based transition effect remain obscure. RESULTS: Utilizing the vast amount of transposable elements in the human genome, we performed detailed analysis of the substitutional and insertion/deletion patterns along the human lineage in a regional and time-resolved fashion. We observed a drastic increase in the CpG-based transition frequency at about the time of the mammalian radiation. We also observed clear regional biases of substitution patterns, most notably a bias to enrich the C+G content toward the telomeres.

title = {Comparative analysis of Alu repeats in primate genomes},
abstract = {Using bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (16.9 Mb) and high-quality alignments of genomic sequences (17.4 Mb), we performed a global assessment of the divergence distributions, phylogenies, and consensus sequences for Alu elements in primates including lemur, marmoset, macaque, baboon, and chimpanzee as compared to human. We found that in lemurs, Alu elements show a broader and more symmetric sequence divergence distribution, suggesting a steady rate of Alu retrotransposition activity among prosimians. In contrast, Alu elements in anthropoids show a skewed distribution shifted toward more ancient elements with continual declining rates in recent Alu activity along the hominoid lineage of evolution. Using an integrated approach combining mutation profile and insertion/deletion analyses, we identified nine novel lineage-specific Alu subfamilies in lemur (seven), marmoset (one), and baboon/macaque (one) containing multiple diagnostic mutations distinct from their human counterparts-Alu J, S, and Y subfamilies, respectively. Among these primates, we show that that the lemur has the lowest density of Alu repeats (55 repeats/Mb), while marmoset has the greatest abundance (188 repeats/Mb). We estimate that approximately 70% of lemur and 16% of marmoset Alu elements belong to lineage-specific subfamilies. Our analysis has provided an evolutionary framework for further classification and refinement of the Alu repeat phylogeny. The differences in the distribution and rates of Alu activity have played an important role in subtly reshaping the structure of primate genomes. The functional consequences of these changes among the diverse primate lineages over such short periods of evolutionary time are an important area of future investigation.},

title = {A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of Mycoplasma genitalium, iPS189},
abstract = {With a genome size of approximately 580 kb and approximately 480 protein coding regions, Mycoplasma genitalium is one of the smallest known self-replicating organisms and, additionally, has extremely fastidious nutrient requirements. The reduced genomic content of M. genitalium has led researchers to suggest that the molecular assembly contained in this organism may be a close approximation to the minimal set of genes required for bacterial growth. Here, we introduce a systematic approach for the construction and curation of a genome-scale in silico metabolic model for M. genitalium. Key challenges included estimation of biomass composition, handling of enzymes with broad specificities, and the lack of a defined medium. Computational tools were subsequently employed to identify and resolve connectivity gaps in the model as well as growth prediction inconsistencies with gene essentiality experimental data. The curated model, M. genitalium iPS189 (262 reactions, 274 metabolites), is 87% accurate in recapitulating in vivo gene essentiality results for M. genitalium. Approaches and tools described herein provide a roadmap for the automated construction of in silico metabolic models of other organisms.},

title = {Reconstruction of ancestral nucleotide sequences and estimation of substitution frequencies in a star phylogeny},
abstract = {Maximum likelihood phylogeny reconstruction methods are widely used in uncovering and assessing the evolutionary history and relationships of natural systems. However, several simplifying assumptions commonly made in this analysis limit the explanatory power of the results obtained. We present an algorithm that performs the phylogenetic analysis without making the common assumptions for sequence data from at least three leaf nodes in a star phylogeny. In particular, the underlying nucleotide substitution model does not have to be reversible and may include neighbor-dependent processes like the CpG methylation deamination process (CpG-effect). The base composition of the sequences at the external nodes and the one of the ancestral sequence may be different from each other and they do not have to be stationary state distributions of the corresponding substitution model. The algorithm is able to reconstruct the ancestral base composition and accurately estimate substitution frequencies in the branches of the star phylogeny. Extensive tests on simulated data validate the very favorable performance of the algorithm. As an application we present the analysis of aligned genomic sequences from human, mouse, and dog. Different substitution pattern can be observed in the three lineages.},

Consequently, it is difficult to maintain a consistent collection of pseudogenes in detail necessary for their effective use. Our database is designed to address this issue. It integrates a variety of heterogeneous resources and supports a subset structure that highlights specific groups of pseudogenes that are of interest to the research community. Tools are provided for the comparison of sets and the creation of layered set unions, enabling researchers to derive a current 'consensus' set of pseudogenes. Additional features include versatile search, the capacity for robust interaction with other databases, the ability to reconstruct older versions of the database (accounting for changing genome builds) and an underlying object-oriented interface designed for researchers with a minimal knowledge of programming.

title = {Transcription-induced mutational strand bias and its effect on substitution rates in human genes},
abstract = {If substitution rates are not the same on the two complementary DNA strands, a substitution is considered strand asymmetric. Such substitutional strand asymmetries are determined here for the three most frequent types of substitution on the human genome (C --> T, A --> G, and G --> T). Substitution rate differences between both strands are estimated for 4,590 human genes by aligning all repeats occurring within the introns with their ancestral consensus sequences. For 1,630 of these genes, both coding strand and noncoding strand rates could be compared with rates in gene-flanking regions. All three rates considered are found to be on average higher on the coding strand and lower on the transcribed strand in comparison to their values in the gene-flanking regions. This finding points to the simultaneous action of rate-increasing effects on the coding strand--such as increased adenine and cytosine deamination--and transcription-coupled repair as a rate-reducing effect on the transcribed strand. The common behavior of the three rates leads to strong correlations of the rate asymmetries: Whenever one rate is strand biased, the other two rates are likely to show the same bias. Furthermore, we determine all three rate asymmetries as a function of time: the A --> G and G --> T rate asymmetries are both found to be constant in time, whereas the C --> T rate asymmetry shows a pronounced time dependence, an observation that explains the difference between our results and those of an earlier work by Green et al. (2003. Transcription-associated mutational asymmetry in mammalian evolution. Nat Genet. 33:514-517.). Finally, we show that in addition to transcription also the replication process biases the substitution rates in genes.},

abstract = {Retrotransposons mobilize via RNA intermediates and usually carry with them the agent of their mobility, reverse transcriptase. Retrotransposons are streamlined, and therefore rely on host factors to proliferate. However, retrotransposons are exposed to cellular forces that block their paths. For this review, we have selected for our focus elements from among target-primed (TP) retrotransposons, also called non-LTR retrotransposons, and extrachromosomally-primed (EP) retrotransposons, also called LTR retrotransposons. The TP retrotransposons considered here are group II introns, LINEs and SINEs, whereas the EP elements considered are the Ty and Tf retrotransposons, with a brief comparison to retroviruses. Recurring themes for these elements, in hosts ranging from bacteria to humans, are tie-ins of the retrotransposons to RNA metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and cellular stress. Likewise, there are parallels among host-cell defenses to combat rampant retrotransposon spread. The interactions between the retrotransposon and the host, and their coevolution to balance the tension between retrotransposon proliferation and host survival, form the basis of this review.},

abstract = {Novel DNA sequencing technologies with the potential for up to three orders magnitude more sequence throughput than conventional Sanger sequencing are emerging. The instrument now available from Solexa Ltd, produces millions of short DNA sequences of 25 nt each. Due to ubiquitous repeats in large genomes and the inability of short sequences to uniquely and unambiguously characterize them, the short read length limits applicability for de novo sequencing. However, given the sequencing depth and the throughput of this instrument, stringent assembly of highly identical sequences can be achieved. We describe SSAKE, a tool for aggressively assembling millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching through a prefix tree for the longest possible overlap between any two sequences. SSAKE is designed to help leverage the information from short sequence reads by stringently assembling them into contiguous sequences that can be used to characterize novel sequencing targets.

title = {Alignment-free sequence comparison-a review},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genetic recombination and, in particular, genetic shuffling are at odds with sequence comparison by alignment, which assumes conservation of contiguity between homologous segments. A variety of theoretical foundations are being used to derive alignment-free methods that overcome this limitation. The formulation of alternative metrics for dissimilarity between sequences and their algorithmic implementations are reviewed. RESULTS: The overwhelming majority of work on alignment-free sequence has taken place in the past two decades, with most reports published in the past 5 years. Two main categories of methods have been proposed-methods based on word (oligomer) frequency, and methods that do not require resolving the sequence with fixed word length segments. The first category is based on the statistics of word frequency, on the distances defined in a Cartesian space defined by the frequency vectors, and on the information content of frequency distribution. The second category includes the use of Kolmogorov complexity and Chaos Theory. Despite their low visibility, alignment-free metrics are in fact already widely used as pre-selection filters for alignment-based querying of large applications. Recent work is furthering their usage as a scale-independent methodology that is capable of recognizing homology when loss of contiguity is beyond the possibility of alignment. Availability: Most of the alignment-free algorithms reviewed were implemented in MATLAB code and are available at http://bioinformatics.musc.edu/resources.html},

title = {CLU: a new algorithm for EST clustering},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The continuous flow of EST data remains one of the richest sources for discoveries in modern biology. The first step in EST data mining is usually associated with EST clustering, the process of grouping of original fragments according to their annotation, similarity to known genomic DNA or each other. Clustered EST data, accumulated in databases such as UniGene, STACK and TIGR Gene Indices have proven to be crucial in research areas from gene discovery to regulation of gene expression. RESULTS: We have developed a new nucleotide sequence matching algorithm and its implementation for clustering EST sequences. The program is based on the original CLU match detection algorithm, which has improved performance over the widely used d2_cluster. The CLU algorithm automatically ignores low-complexity regions like poly-tracts and short tandem repeats. CONCLUSION: CLU represents a new generation of EST clustering algorithm with improved performance over current approaches. An early implementation can be applied in small and medium-size projects. The CLU program is available on an open source basis free of charge. It can be downloaded from http://compbio.pbrc.edu/pti.},

Highly efficient automatic screening of the data allows deposition of the annotated sequences without delay. Sequences have been generated from 26 oligo(dT) primed directionally cloned libraries, of which 18 were normalized. The libraries were constructed using mRNA isolated from 17 different tissues representing three developmental states. Comparisons of a subset of our data with nonredundant human mRNA and protein data bases show that the ESTs represent many known sequences and contain many that are novel. Analysis of protein families using Hidden Markov Models confirms this observation and supports the contention that although normalization reduces significantly the relative abundance of redundant cDNA clones, it does not result in the complete removal of members of gene families.},

title = {Spontaneous mutations leading to antigenic variations in the glycoproteins of vesicular stomatitis virus field isolates},
abstract = {Strains of vesicular stomatitis virus, New Jersey serotype (VSV-NJ), isolated from diseased cattle or swine were examined by genomic RNA sequencing for genetic diversity potentially leading to antigenic variations in their type-specific glycoproteins as determined by reactivity with epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Seven field isolates recovered in Colorado, New Mexico, Georgia, and Mexico during the widespread 1982-1985 epizootic in the western United States resembled the prototypic 1952 Hazelhurst subtype by partial sequence homology, but amino acid reversions to the 1949 Ogden subtype occurred frequently. When studies were performed with MAbs directed to the Ogden subtype glycoprotein, relatively limited antigenic variation, and only in neutralization epitope VIII, was noted among two of five epizootic isolates from Colorado and New Mexico. However, amino acid differences in the glycoprotein of a 1983 isolate from an enzootic region of Georgia resulted in major antigenic deficiencies in epitopes V, VI, and VII as determined by Western blotting and neutralization of infectivity with epitope-specific MAbs. Quite a few genetic but no antigenic differences were noted in an enzootic 1984 isolate from Mexico, a potential origin of the United States epizootic. Marked or complete loss of epitopes VII, VI, VIII, and V can be traced to spontaneous mutations leading to amino acid substitutions at glycoprotein positions 199, 263, 275, and 317, respectively, in the enzootic Georgia isolate 07/83-GA-P and the epizootic New Mexico isolate 06/85-NM-B. By comparison, closely adjacent amino acid substitutions at glycoprotein positions 210, 268, 277, and 364 occurred in epitope-deficient mutants selected for resistance to neutralization by MAbs specific for epitopes VII, VI, VIII, and V, respectively. Two neutralization epitopes designated X and XI were found to be unique for the G protein of the 1952 Hazelhurst isolate..../52-GA-P. The epitope X-specific MAb H21, in particular, failed to neutralize the infectivity not only of the Ogden subtype..../49-UT-B but also was ineffective against all the 1982-1985 field isolates. The classical 1952 Hazelhurst strain of VSV-NJ is genetically and antigenically quite different from those viruses isolated during the 1982-1985 epizootic.},

title = {DNA transposons and the evolution of eukaryotic genomes},
abstract = {Transposable elements are mobile genetic units that exhibit broad diversity in their structure and transposition mechanisms. Transposable elements occupy a large fraction of many eukaryotic genomes and their movement and accumulation represent a major force shaping the genes and genomes of almost all organisms. This review focuses on DNA-mediated or class 2 transposons and emphasizes how this class of elements is distinguished from other types of mobile elements in terms of their structure, amplification dynamics, and genomic effect. We provide an up-to-date outlook on the diversity and taxonomic distribution of all major types of DNA transposons in eukaryotes, including Helitrons and Mavericks. We discuss some of the evolutionary forces that influence their maintenance and diversification in various genomic environments. Finally, we highlight how the distinctive biological features of DNA transposons have contributed to shape genome architecture and led to the emergence of genetic innovations in different eukaryotic lineages.},

title = {RBR: library-less repeat detection for ESTs},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Repeat sequences in ESTs are a source of problems, in particular for clustering. ESTs are therefore commonly masked against a library of known repeats. High quality repeat libraries are available for the widely studied organisms, but for most other organisms the lack of such libraries is likely to compromise the quality of EST analysis. RESULTS: We present a fast, flexible and library-less method for masking repeats in EST sequences, based on match statistics within the EST collection. The method is not linked to a particular clustering algorithm. Extensive testing on datasets using different clustering methods and a genomic mapping as reference shows that this method gives results that are better than or as good as those obtained using RepeatMasker with a repeat library.

abstract = {The availability of massive amounts of DNA sequence information has begun to revolutionize the practice of biology. As a result, current large-scale sequencing output, while impressive, is not adequate to keep pace with growing demand and, in particular, is far short of what will be required to obtain the 3-billion-base human genome sequence by the target date of 2005. To reach this goal, improved automation will be essential, and it is particularly important that human involvement in sequence data processing be significantly reduced or eliminated. Progress in this respect will require both improved accuracy of the data processing software and reliable accuracy measures to reduce the need for human involvement in error correction and make human review more efficient. Here, we describe one step toward that goal: a base-calling program for automated sequencer traces, phred, with improved accuracy. phred appears to be the first base-calling program to achieve a lower error rate than the ABI software, averaging 40%-50% fewer errors in the data sets examined independent of position in read, machine running conditions, or sequencing chemistry.},

abstract = {Rates of molecular evolution vary widely between lineages, but quantification of how rates change has proven difficult. Recently proposed estimation procedures have mainly adopted highly parametric approaches that model rate evolution explicitly. In this study, a semiparametric smoothing method is developed using penalized likelihood. A saturated model in which every lineage has a separate rate is combined with a roughness penalty that discourages rates from varying too much across a phylogeny. A data-driven cross-validation criterion is then used to determine an optimal level of smoothing. This criterion is based on an estimate of the average prediction error associated with pruning lineages from the tree. The methods are applied to three data sets of six genes across a sample of land plants. Optimally smoothed estimates of absolute rates entailed 2- to 10-fold variation across lineages.},

title = {Gene discovery and annotation using LCM-454 transcriptome sequencing},
abstract = {454 DNA sequencing technology achieves significant throughput relative to traditional approaches. More than 261,000 ESTs were generated by 454 Life Sciences from cDNA isolated using laser capture microdissection (LCM) from the developmentally important shoot apical meristem (SAM) of maize (Zea mays L.). This single sequencing run annotated >25,000 maize genomic sequences and also captured approximately 400 expressed transcripts for which homologous sequences have not yet been identified in other species. Approximately 70% of the ESTs generated in this study had not been captured during a previous EST project conducted using a cDNA library constructed from hand-dissected apex tissue that is highly enriched for SAMs. In addition, at least 30% of the 454-ESTs do not align to any of the approximately 648,000 extant maize ESTs using conservative alignment criteria. These results indicate that the combination of LCM and the deep sequencing possible with 454 technology enriches for SAM transcripts not present in current EST collections. RT-PCR was used to validate the expression of 27 genes whose expression had been detected in the SAM via LCM-454 technology, but that lacked orthologs in GenBank. Significantly, transcripts from approximately 74% (20/27) of these validated SAM-expressed "orphans" were not detected in meristem-rich immature ears. We conclude that the coupling of LCM and 454 sequencing technologies facilitates the discovery of rare, possibly cell-type-specific transcripts.},

We determined the genome sequence of an Indian-origin Macaca mulatta female and compared the data with chimpanzees and humans to reveal the structure of ancestral primate genomes and to identify evidence for positive selection and lineage-specific expansions and contractions of gene families. A comparison of sequences from individual animals was used to investigate their underlying genetic diversity.

abstract = {Driven by rapid improvements in affordable computing power and by the even faster accumulation of genomic data, the statistical analysis of molecular sequence data has become an active area of interdisciplinary research. Maximum likelihood methods have become mainstream because of their desirable properties and, more importantly, their potential for providing statistically sound solutions in complex data analysis settings. In this chapter, a review of recent literature focusing on rates and patterns of nucleotide substitution rates in the nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genomes of plants demonstrates the power and flexibility of these new methods. The emerging picture of the nucleotide substitution process in plants is a complex one. Evolutionary rates are seen to be quite variable, both among genes and among plant lineages. However, there are hints, particularly in the chloroplast, that individual factors can have important effects on many genes simultaneously.},

title = {Integrated pseudogene annotation for human chromosome 22: evidence for transcription},
abstract = {Pseudogenes are inheritable genetic elements formally defined by two properties: their similarity to functioning genes and their presumed lack of activity. However, their precise characterization, particularly with respect to the latter quality, has proven elusive. An opportunity to explore this issue arises from the recent emergence of tiling-microarray data showing that intergenic regions (containing pseudogenes) are transcribed to a great degree. Here we focus on the transcriptional activity of pseudogenes on human chromosome 22. First, we integrated several sets of annotation to define a unified list of 525 pseudogenes on the chromosome. To characterize these further, we developed a comprehensive list of genomic features based on conservation in related organisms, expression evidence, and the presence of upstream regulatory sites. Of the 525 unified pseudogenes we could confidently classify 154 as processed and 49 as duplicated. Using data from tiling microarrays, especially from recent high-resolution oligonucleotide arrays, we found some evidence that up to a fifth of the 525 pseudogenes are potentially transcribed. Expressed sequence tags (EST) comparison further validated a number of these, and overall we found 17 pseudogenes with strong support for transcription. In particular, one of the pseudogenes with both EST and microarray evidence for transcription turned out to be a duplicated pseudogene in the cat eye syndrome critical region. Although we could not identify a meaningful number of transcription factor-binding sites (based on chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip data) near pseudogenes, we did find that approximately 12% of the pseudogenes had upstream CpG islands. Finally, analysis of corresponding syntenic regions in the mouse, rat and chimp genomes indicates, as previously suggested, that pseudogenes are less conserved than genes, but more preserved than the intergenic background (all notation is available from http://www.pseudogene.org).},

abstract = {Repetitive sequences make up a significant fraction of almost any genome, and an important and still open question in bioinformatics is how to represent all repeats in DNA sequences. We propose a new approach to repeat classification that represents all repeats in a genome as a mosaic of sub-repeats. Our key algorithmic idea also leads to new approaches to multiple alignment and fragment assembly. In particular, we show that our FragmentGluer assembler improves on Phrap and ARACHNE in assembly of BACs and bacterial genomes.},

abstract = {Recent advances in genomics and structural biology have resulted in an unprecedented increase in biological data available from Internet-accessible databases. In order to help students effectively use this vast repository of information, undergraduate biology students at Drake University were introduced to bioinformatics software and databases in three courses, beginning with an introductory course in cell biology. The exercises and projects that were used to help students develop literacy in bioinformatics are described. In a recently offered course in bioinformatics, students developed their own simple sequence analysis tool using the Perl programming language. These experiences are described from the point of view of the instructor as well as the students. A preliminary assessment has been made of the degree to which students had developed a working knowledge of bioinformatics concepts and methods. Finally, some conclusions have been drawn from these courses that may be helpful to instructors wishing to introduce bioinformatics within the undergraduate biology curriculum.},

abstract = {Genetic sequence alignment is the basis of many evolutionary and comparative studies, and errors in alignments lead to errors in the interpretation of evolutionary information in genomes. Traditional multiple sequence alignment methods disregard the phylogenetic implications of gap patterns that they create and infer systematically biased alignments with excess deletions and substitutions, too few insertions, and implausible insertion-deletion-event histories. We present a method that prevents these systematic errors by recognizing insertions and deletions as distinct evolutionary events. We show theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic alignment problems. These results suggest that insertions and sequence turnover are more common than is currently thought and challenge the conventional picture of sequence evolution and mechanisms of functional and structural changes.},

RESULTS: Protein interaction graphs were separated into subgraphs of interconnected proteins, using the JUNG implementation of Girvan and Newman's Edge-Betweenness algorithm. Functions were sought for these subgraphs by detecting significant correlations with the distribution of Gene Ontology terms which had been used to annotate the proteins within each cluster. The method was implemented using freely available software (JUNG and the R statistical package). Protein clusters with significant correlations to functional annotations could be identified and included groups of proteins know to cooperate in cell metabolism. The method appears to be resilient against the presence of false positive interactions. CONCLUSION: This method provides a useful tool for rapid screening of small to medium size protein interaction datasets.},

title = {Human-macaque comparisons illuminate variation in neutral substitution rates},
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The evolutionary distance between human and macaque is particularly attractive for investigating local variation in neutral substitution rates, because substitutions can be inferred more reliably than in comparisons with rodents and are less influenced by the effects of current and ancient diversity than in comparisons with closer primates. Here we investigate the human-macaque neutral substitution rate as a function of a number of genomic parameters. RESULTS: Using regression analyses we find that male mutation bias, male (but not female) recombination rate, distance to telomeres and substitution rates computed from orthologous regions in mouse-rat and dog-cow comparisons are prominent predictors of the neutral rate. Additionally, we demonstrate that the previously observed biphasic relationship between neutral rate and GC content can be accounted for by properly combining rates at CpG and non-CpG sites. Finally, we find the neutral rate to be negatively correlated with the densities of several classes of computationally predicted functional elements, and less so with the densities of certain classes of experimentally verified functional elements. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that while female recombination may be mainly responsible for driving evolution in GC content, male recombination may be mutagenic, and that other mutagenic mechanisms acting near telomeres, and mechanisms whose effects are shared across mammalian genomes, play significant roles. We also have evidence that the nonlinear increase in rates at high GC levels may be largely due to hyper-mutability of CpG dinucleotides. Finally, our results suggest that the performance of conservation-based prediction methods can be improved by accounting for neutral rates.},

title = {Preservation of a pseudogene by gene conversion and diversifying selection},
abstract = {Interlocus gene conversion is considered a crucial mechanism for generating novel combinations of polymorphisms in duplicated genes. The importance of gene conversion between duplicated genes has been recognized in the major histocompatibility complex and self-incompatibility genes, which are likely subject to diversifying selection. To theoretically understand the potential role of gene conversion in such situations, forward simulations are performed in various two-locus models. The results show that gene conversion could significantly increase the number of haplotypes when diversifying selection works on both loci. We find that the tract length of gene conversion is an important factor to determine the efficacy of gene conversion: shorter tract lengths can more effectively generate novel haplotypes given the gene conversion rate per site is the same. Similar results are also obtained when one of the duplicated genes is assumed to be a pseudogene. It is suggested that a duplicated gene, even after being silenced, will contribute to increasing the variability in the other locus through gene conversion. Consequently, the fixation probability and longevity of duplicated genes increase under the presence of gene conversion. On the basis of these findings, we propose a new scenario for the preservation of a duplicated gene: when the original donor gene is under diversifying selection, a duplicated copy can be preserved by gene conversion even after it is pseudogenized.},

title = {Decomposition of overlapping protein complexes: a graph theoretical method for analyzing static and dynamic protein associations},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most cellular processes are carried out by multi-protein complexes, groups of proteins that bind together to perform a specific task. Some proteins form stable complexes, while other proteins form transient associations and are part of several complexes at different stages of a cellular process. A better understanding of this higher-order organization of proteins into overlapping complexes is an important step towards unveiling functional and evolutionary mechanisms behind biological networks. RESULTS: We propose a new method for identifying and representing overlapping protein complexes (or larger units called functional groups) within a protein interaction network. We develop a graph-theoretical framework that enables automatic construction of such representation. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to TNFalpha/NF-kappaB and pheromone signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: The proposed representation helps in understanding the transitions between functional groups and allows for tracking a protein's path through a cascade of functional groups. Therefore, depending on the nature of the network, our representation is capable of elucidating temporal relations between functional groups. Our results show that the proposed method opens a new avenue for the analysis of protein interaction networks.},

title = {A clustering method for repeat analysis in DNA sequences},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A computational system for analysis of the repetitive structure of genomic sequences is described. The method uses suffix trees to organize and search the input sequences; this data structure has been used previously for efficient computation of exact and degenerate repeats. RESULTS: The resulting software tool collects all repeat classes and outputs summary statistics as well as a file containing multiple sequences (multi fasta), that can be used as the target of searches. Its use is demonstrated here on several complete microbial genomes, the entire Arabidopsis thaliana genome, and a large collection of rice bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a new clustering method for analysis of the repeat data captured in suffix trees. This method has been incorporated into a system that can find repeats in individual genome sequences or sets of sequences, and that can organize those repeats into classes. It quickly and accurately creates repeat databases from small and large genomes. The associated software (RepeatFinder), should prove helpful in the analysis of repeat structure for both complete and partial genome sequences.},

Over 7000 families of repetitive sequences were identified. The size of the families ranged from isolated pairs to over 1600 segments of similar sequence. Approximately 12.3% of the analyzed sequence participates in a repeat element.},

title = {Compilation of mRNA polyadenylation signals in Arabidopsis revealed a new signal element and potential secondary structures},
abstract = {Using a novel program, SignalSleuth, and a database containing authenticated polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites, we analyzed the composition of mRNA poly(A) signals in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and reevaluated previously described cis-elements within the 3'-untranslated (UTR) regions, including near upstream elements and far upstream elements. As predicted, there are absences of high-consensus signal patterns. The AAUAAA signal topped the near upstream elements patterns and was found within the predicted location to only approximately 10% of 3'-UTRs. More importantly, we identified a new set, named cleavage elements, of poly(A) signals flanking both sides of the cleavage site. These cis-elements were not previously revealed by conventional mutagenesis and are contemplated as a cluster of signals for cleavage site recognition. Moreover, a single-nucleotide profile scan on the 3'-UTR regions unveiled a distinct arrangement of alternate stretches of U and A nucleotides, which led to a prediction of the formation of secondary structures. Using an RNA secondary structure prediction program, mFold, we identified three main types of secondary structures on the sequences analyzed. Surprisingly, these observed secondary structures were all interrupted in previously constructed mutations in these regions. These results will enable us to revise the current model of plant poly(A) signals and to develop tools to predict 3'-ends for gene annotation.},

title = {Genome analysis of the platypus reveals unique signatures of evolution},
abstract = {We present a draft genome sequence of the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus. This monotreme exhibits a fascinating combination of reptilian and mammalian characters. For example, platypuses have a coat of fur adapted to an aquatic lifestyle; platypus females lactate, yet lay eggs; and males are equipped with venom similar to that of reptiles. Analysis of the first monotreme genome aligned these features with genetic innovations. We find that reptile and platypus venom proteins have been co-opted independently from the same gene families; milk protein genes are conserved despite platypuses laying eggs; and immune gene family expansions are directly related to platypus biology. Expansions of protein, non-protein-coding RNA and microRNA families, as well as repeat elements, are identified. Sequencing of this genome now provides a valuable resource for deep mammalian comparative analyses, as well as for monotreme biology and conservation.},

title = {PAVE: program for assembling and viewing ESTs},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: New sequencing technologies are rapidly emerging. Many laboratories are simultaneously working with the traditional Sanger ESTs and experimenting with ESTs generated by the 454 Life Science sequencers. Though Sanger ESTs have been used to generate contigs for many years, no program takes full advantage of the 5' and 3' mate-pair information, hence, many tentative transcripts are assembled into two separate contigs. The new 454 technology has the benefit of high-throughput expression profiling, but introduces time and space problems for assembling large contigs. RESULTS: The PAVE (Program for Assembling and Viewing ESTs) assembler takes advantage of the 5' and 3' mate-pair information by requiring that the mate-pairs be assembled into the same contig and joined by n's if the two sub-contigs do not overlap. It handles the depth of 454 data sets by "burying" similar ESTs during assembly, which retains the expression level information while circumventing time and space problems. PAVE uses MegaBLAST for the clustering step and CAP3 for assembly, however it assembles incrementally to enforce the mate-pair constraint, bury ESTs, and reduce incorrect joins and splits. The PAVE data management system uses a MySQL database to store multiple libraries of ESTs along with their metadata; the management system allows multiple assemblies with variations on libraries and parameters. Analysis routines provide standard annotation for the contigs including a measure of differentially expressed genes across the libraries. A Java viewer program is provided for display and analysis of the results. Our results clearly show the benefit of using the PAVE assembler to explicitly use mate-pair information and bury ESTs for large contigs. CONCLUSION: The PAVE assembler provides a software package for assembling Sanger and/or 454 ESTs. The assembly software, data management software, Java viewer and user's guide are freely available.},

For gene sequencers, the vast stretches of non-coding DNA found in eukaryotic genomes were largely considered to be an annoyance, whereas genome-size researchers attributed little relevance to specific nucleotide sequences. However, the dawn of comprehensive genome sequencing has allowed a new synergy between these fields, with sequence data providing novel insights into genome-size evolution, and with genome-size data being of both practical and theoretical significance for large-scale sequence analysis. In combination, these formerly disconnected disciplines are poised to deliver a greatly improved understanding of genome structure and evolution.},

The datasystem organizes and reconstructs human transcripts from available public data in the context of expression state. The expression state of a transcript can include developmental state, pathological association, site of expression and isoform of expressed transcript. STACK consensus transcripts are reconstructed from clusters that capture and reflect the growing evidence of transcript diversity. The comprehensive capture of transcript variants is achieved by the use of a novel clustering approach that is tolerant of sub-sequence diversity and does not rely on pairwise alignment. This is in contrast with other gene indexing projects. STACK is generated at least four times a year and represents the exhaustive processing of all publicly available human EST data extracted from GenBank. This processed information can be explored through 15 tissue-specific categories, a disease-related category and a whole-body index and is accessible via WWW at http://www.sanbi.ac.za/Dbases.html. STACK represents a broadly applicable resource, as it is the only reconstructed transcript database for which the tools for its generation are also broadly available (http://www.sanbi.ac.za/CODES).},

title = {A distal enhancer and an ultraconserved exon are derived from a novel retroposon},
abstract = {Hundreds of highly conserved distal cis-regulatory elements have been characterized so far in vertebrate genomes. Many thousands more are predicted on the basis of comparative genomics. However, in stark contrast to the genes that they regulate, in invertebrates virtually none of these regions can be traced by using sequence similarity, leaving their evolutionary origins obscure. Here we show that a class of conserved, primarily non-coding regions in tetrapods originated from a previously unknown short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) retroposon family that was active in the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes and terrestrial vertebrates) in the Silurian period at least 410 million years ago (ref. 4), and seems to be recently active in the 'living fossil' Indonesian coelacanth, Latimeria menadoensis. Using a mouse enhancer assay we show that one copy, 0.5 million bases from the neuro-developmental gene ISL1, is an enhancer that recapitulates multiple aspects of Isl1 expression patterns. Several other copies represent new, possibly regulatory, alternatively spliced exons in the middle of pre-existing Sarcopterygian genes. One of these, a more than 200-base-pair ultraconserved region, 100% identical in mammals, and 80% identical to the coelacanth SINE, contains a 31-amino-acid-residue alternatively spliced exon of the messenger RNA processing gene PCBP2 (ref. 6). These add to a growing list of examples in which relics of transposable elements have acquired a function that serves their host, a process termed 'exaptation', and provide an origin for at least some of the many highly conserved vertebrate-specific genomic sequences.},

abstract = {Complete and partial sequences of mariner-like elements (MLEs) have been reported for hundreds of species of animals, but only two have been identified in plants. On the basis of these two plant MLEs and several related sequences identified by database searches, plant-specific degenerate primers were derived and used to amplify a conserved region of MLE transposase genes from a variety of plant genomes. Positive products were obtained for 6 dicots and 31 monocots of 54 plant species tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 68 distinct MLE transposase sequences from 25 grass species is consistent with vertical transmission and rapid diversification of multiple lineages of transposases. Surprisingly, the evolution of MLEs in grasses was accompanied by repeated and independent acquisition of introns in a localized region of the transposase gene.},

title = {A comprehensive approach to clustering of expressed human gene sequence: the sequence tag alignment and consensus knowledge base},
abstract = {The expressed human genome is being sequenced and analyzed by disparate groups producing disparate data. The majority of the identified coding portion is in the form of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The need to discover exonic representation and expression forms of full-length cDNAs for each human gene is frustrated by the partial and variable quality nature of this data delivery. A highly redundant human EST data set has been processed into integrated and unified expressed transcript indices that consist of hierarchically organized human transcript consensi reflecting gene expression forms and genetic polymorphism within an index class. The expression index and its intermediate outputs include cleaned transcript sequence, expression, and alignment information and a higher fidelity subset, SANIGENE. The STACK_PACK clustering system has been applied to dbEST release 121598 (GenBank version 110). Sixty-four percent of 1,313, 103 Homo sapiens ESTs are condensed into 143,885 tissue level multiple sequence clusters; linking through clone-ID annotations produces 68,701 total assemblies, such that 81% of the original input set is captured in a STACK multiple sequence or linked cluster. Indexing of alignments by substituent EST accession allows browsing of the data structure and its cross-links to UniGene. STACK metaclusters consolidate a greater number of ESTs by a factor of 1. 86 with respect to the corresponding UniGene build. Fidelity comparison with genome reference sequence AC004106 demonstrates consensus expression clusters that reflect significantly lower spurious repeat sequence content and capture alternate splicing within a whole body index cluster and three STACK v.2.3 tissue-level clusters. Statistics of a staggered release whole body index build of STACK v.2.0 are presented.},

title = {Iterative cluster analysis of protein interaction data},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Generation of fast tools of hierarchical clustering to be applied when distances among elements of a set are constrained, causing frequent distance ties, as happens in protein interaction data. RESULTS: We present in this work the program UVCLUSTER, that iteratively explores distance datasets using hierarchical clustering. Once the user selects a group of proteins, UVCLUSTER converts the set of primary distances among them (i.e. the minimum number of steps, or interactions, required to connect two proteins) into secondary distances that measure the strength of the connection between each pair of proteins when the interactions for all the proteins in the group are considered. We show that this novel strategy has advantages over conventional clustering methods to explore protein-protein interaction data. UVCLUSTER easily incorporates the information of the largest available interaction datasets to generate comprehensive primary distance tables. The versatility, simplicity of use and high speed of UVCLUSTER on standard personal computers suggest that it can be a benchmark analytical tool for interactome data analysis.

title = {Comparison of multiple vertebrate genomes reveals the birth and evolution of human exons},
abstract = {Orthologous gene structures in eight vertebrate species were compared on a genomic scale to detect the birth and maturation of new internal exons during the course of evolution. We found that 40% of new human exons are alternatively spliced, and most of these are cassette exons (exons that are either included or skipped in their entirety) with low inclusion rates. This proportion decreases steadily as older and older exons are examined, even as splicing efficiency increases. Remarkably, the great majority of new cassette exons are composed of highly repeated sequences, especially Alu. Many new cassette exons are 5' untranslated exons; the proportion that code for protein increases steadily with age. New protein-coding exons evolve at a high rate, as evidenced by the initially high substitution rates (K(s) and K(a)), as well as the SNP density compared with older exons. This dynamic picture suggests that de novo recruitment rather than shuffling is the major route by which exons are added to genes, and that species-specific repeats could play a significant role in recent evolution.},

-- Young exons are more likely to overlap repeats (ALUs)
-- Cassette exons tend to be younger

A common shortcoming of the available tools is their inability to efficiently assemble vast amounts of data generated from large-scale sequencing projects, such as the sequencing of individual human genomes to catalog natural genetic variation. To address this limitation, we developed ABySS (Assembly By Short Sequences), a parallelized sequence assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled 3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately 2.76 million contigs > or =100 base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing 68% of the reference human genome. Analysis of these contigs identified polymorphic and novel sequences not present in the human reference assembly, which were validated by alignment to alternate human assemblies and to other primate genomes.},

title = {Development and implementation of an algorithm for detection of protein complexes in large interaction networks},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: After complete sequencing of a number of genomes the focus has now turned to proteomics. Advanced proteomics technologies such as two-hybrid assay, mass spectrometry etc. are producing huge data sets of protein-protein interactions which can be portrayed as networks, and one of the burning issues is to find protein complexes in such networks. The enormous size of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks warrants development of efficient computational methods for extraction of significant complexes. RESULTS: This paper presents an algorithm for detection of protein complexes in large interaction networks. In a PPI network, a node represents a protein and an edge represents an interaction. The input to the algorithm is the associated matrix of an interaction network and the outputs are protein complexes. The complexes are determined by way of finding clusters, i. e. the densely connected regions in the network. We also show and analyze some protein complexes generated by the proposed algorithm from typical PPI networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A comparison between a PPI and a random network is also performed in the context of the proposed algorithm. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm makes it possible to detect clusters of proteins in PPI networks which mostly represent molecular biological functional units. Therefore, protein complexes determined solely based on interaction data can help us to predict the functions of proteins, and they are also useful to understand and explain certain biological processes.},

As the number of genome sequencing projects increases, there is a pressing need to identify the repeat families present in large, newly sequenced genomes.

title = {A graph based algorithm for generating EST consensus sequences},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: EST sequences constitute an abundant, yet error prone resource for computational biology. Expressed sequences are important in gene discovery and identification, and they are also crucial for the discovery and classification of alternative splicing. An important challenge when processing EST sequences is the reconstruction of mRNA by assembling EST clusters into consensus sequences. RESULTS: In contrast to the more established assembly tools, we propose an algorithm that constructs a graph over sequence fragments of fixed size, and produces consensus sequences as traversals of this graph. We provide a tool implementing this algorithm, and perform an experiment where the consensus sequences produced by our implementation, as well as by currently available tools, are compared to mRNA. The results show that our proposed algorithm in a majority of the cases produces consensus of higher quality than the established sequence assemblers and at a competitive speed.

abstract = {Because of the extensive oligosaccharide heterogeneity of the membrane glycoprotein (G) from the Hazelhurst strain of vesicular stomatitis virus, this virus has been used as a specific intracellular probe of altered protein glycosylation in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed versus normal baby hamster kidney cells. Over 70% of G protein from virus released from the transformed cells had acidic-type oligosaccharides at both glycosylation sites, compared to less than 50% from the corresponding normal host cells. The remaining G protein contained an acidic-type oligosaccharide at one site and an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive oligosaccharide at the other. The major endoglycosidase-sensitive species were sialylated hybrid-type (NeuNAc-Gal-GlcNAc-Man5GlcNAc2-Asn) from the transformed and neutral-type (Man5-6GlcNAc2-Asn) from the normal host cells. The degree of branching of the acidic-type oligosaccharides was not increased in the transformed cells (approx. 80% biantennary for viral G protein from both cell types). At a reduced growth temperature (24 versus 37 degrees C), the G protein oligosaccharides were more extensively processed in both cell types (approximately 85-95% of G protein contained acidic-type structures at both sites), even though the level of viral protein synthesis and virus release was decreased. Essentially all of the minor, endoglycosidase-sensitive oligosaccharides on mature viral G protein were sialic acid-containing hybrid-type structures. At 24 degrees C the branching of the acidic-type oligosaccharides was increased in the virus released from the transformed cells versus normal cells.},

abstract = {Despite their small size and reduced genomes, many mycoplasma cells have complex structures involved in virulence. Mycoplasma pneumoniae has served as a model for the study of virulence factors of a variety of mycoplasma species that cause disease in humans and animals. These cells feature an attachment organelle, which mediates cytadherence and gliding motility and is required for virulence. An essential component of the architecture of the attachment organelle is an internal detergent-insoluble structure, the electron-dense core. Little information is known regarding its underlying mechanisms. Mycoplasma amphoriforme, a close relative of both M. pneumoniae and the avian pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum, is a recently discovered organism associated with chronic bronchitis in immunosuppressed individuals. This work describes both the ultrastructure of M. amphoriforme strain A39(T) as visualized by scanning electron microscopy and the gliding motility characteristics of this organism on glass. Though externally resembling M. gallisepticum, M. amphoriforme cells were found to have a Triton X-100-insoluble structure similar to the M. pneumoniae electron-dense core but with different dimensions. M. amphoriforme also exhibited gliding motility using time-lapse microcinematography; its movement was slower than that of either M. pneumoniae or M. gallisepticum.},

title = {Attachment organelle ultrastructure correlates with phylogeny, not gliding motility properties, in Mycoplasma pneumoniae relatives},
abstract = {The Mycoplasma pneumoniae cluster is a clade of eight described species which all exhibit cellular polarity. Their polar attachment organelle is a hub of cellular activities including cytadherence and gliding motility, and its duplication in the species M. pneumoniae is coordinated with cell division and DNA replication. The attachment organelle houses a detergent-insoluble, electron-dense core whose presence is required for structural integrity. Although mutant analysis has led to the identification of attachment organelle proteins, the mechanistic basis for the activities of the attachment organelle remains poorly understood, with gliding motility attributed alternatively to the core or to the adhesins. In this study we investigated attachment organelle-associated phenotypes, including gliding motility characteristics and ultrastructural details, in seven species of the M. pneumoniae cluster under identical conditions, allowing direct comparison. We identified gliding ability in three species in which it has not previously been reported, Mycoplasma imitans, Mycoplasma pirum and Mycoplasma testudinis. Across species, ultrastructural features of attachment organelles and their cores do not correlate with gliding speed, and morphological features of cores are inconsistent with predictions about how these structures are involved in the gliding process, disfavouring a prominent, direct role for the electron-dense core in gliding. In addition, we found M. pneumoniae to be an outlier in terms of cell structure with respect to its close relatives, suggesting that it has acquired a special set of adaptations during its evolution.},

Our analysis of the public EST sequences, available through the TIGR Gene Indices (TGI; http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tdb.html ), is an attempt to identify the genes represented by that data and to provide additional information regarding those genes. Gene Indices are constructed for selected organisms by first clustering, then assembling EST and annotated gene sequences from GenBank. This process produces a set of unique, high-fidelity virtual transcripts, or tentative consensus (TC) sequences.

title = {Genomic heterogeneity of background substitutional patterns in Drosophila melanogaster},
abstract = {Mutation is the underlying force that provides the variation upon which evolutionary forces can act. It is important to understand how mutation rates vary within genomes and how the probabilities of fixation of new mutations vary as well. If substitutional processes across the genome are heterogeneous, then examining patterns of coding sequence evolution without taking these underlying variations into account may be misleading. Here we present the first rigorous test of substitution rate heterogeneity in the Drosophila melanogaster genome using almost 1500 nonfunctional fragments of the transposable element DNAREP1_DM. Not only do our analyses suggest that substitutional patterns in heterochromatic and euchromatic sequences are different, but also they provide support in favor of a recombination-associated substitutional bias toward G and C in this species. The magnitude of this bias is entirely sufficient to explain recombination-associated patterns of codon usage on the autosomes of the D. melanogaster genome. We also document a bias toward lower GC content in the pattern of small insertions and deletions (indels). In addition, the GC content of noncoding DNA in Drosophila is higher than would be predicted on the basis of the pattern of nucleotide substitutions and small indels. However, we argue that the fast turnover of noncoding sequences in Drosophila makes it difficult to assess the importance of the GC biases in nucleotide substitutions and small indels in shaping the base composition of noncoding sequences.},

title = {Birth of a retroposon: the Twin SINE family from the vector mosquito Culex pipiens may have originated from a dimeric tRNA precursor},
abstract = {SINEs are short interspersed repetitive elements found in many eukaryotic genomes and are believed to propagate by retroposition. Almost all SINEs reported to date have a composite structure made of a 5' tRNA-related region followed by a tRNA-unrelated region. Here, we describe a new type of tRNA-derived SINEs from the genome of the mosquito Culex pipiens. These elements, called TWINs, are approximately 220 bp long and reiterated at approximately 500 copies per haploid genome. TWINs have a unique structure compared with other tRNA-SINEs described so far. They consist of two tRNA(Arg)-related regions separated by a 39-bp spacer. Other tRNA-unrelated sequences include a 5-bp leader preceding the left tRNA-like unit and a short trailer located downstream of the right tRNA-like region. This 3' trailer is a 10-bp sequence that is ended by a TTTT motif and followed by a polyA tract of variable length. The right tRNA-like unit also contains a 16-bp sequence which is absent in the left one and appears to be located in the ancestral anticodon stem precisely at a position expected for a nuclear tRNA intron. According to this singular structure, we hypothesize that the TWIN: SINE family originated from an unprocessed polymerase III transcript containing two tRNA sequences. We suggest that some peculiar properties acquired by this dicistronic transcript, such as a polyA tail and a 3' stem-loop secondary structure, promote its retroposition by increasing its chances of being recognized by a reverse transcriptase encoded elsewhere in the C. pipiens genome.},

abstract = {Since their discovery in family Bovidae (bovids), Bov-B LINEs, believed to be order-specific SINEs, have been found in all ruminants and recently also in Viperidae snakes. The distribution and the evolutionary relationships of Bov-B LINEs provide an indication of their origin and evolutionary dynamics in different species. The evolutionary origin of Bov-B LINE elements has been shown unequivocally to be in Squamata (squamates). The horizontal transfer of Bov-B LINE elements in vertebrates has been confirmed by their discontinuous phylogenetic distribution in Squamata (Serpentes and two lizard infra-orders) as well as in Ruminantia, by the high level of nucleotide identity, and by their phylogenetic relationships. The direction of horizontal transfer from Squamata to the ancestor of Ruminantia is evident from the genetic distances and discontinuous phylogenetic distribution of Bov-B LINE elements. The ancestral snake lineage (Boidae) has been recognized as a possible donor of Bov-B LINE elements to Ruminantia. The timing of horizontal transfer has been estimated from the distribution of Bov-B LINE elements in Ruminantia and the fossil data of Ruminantia to be 40-50 mya. The phylogenetic relationships of Bov-B LINE elements from the various Squamata species agrees with that of the species phylogeny, suggesting that Bov-B LINE elements have been stably maintained by vertical transmission since the origin of Squamata in the Mesozoic era.},

title = {DNA-binding specificity of rice mariner-like transposases and interactions with Stowaway MITEs},
abstract = {Mariner-like elements (MLEs) are DNA transposons found throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. A previous computational survey of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequence revealed 34 full length MLEs (Osmars) belonging to 25 distinct families. This survey, which also identified sequence similarities between the Osmar elements and the Stowaway superfamily of MITEs, led to the formulation of a hypothesis whereby Stowaways are mobilized by OSMAR transposases. Here we investigate the DNA-binding activities and specificities of two OSMAR transposases, OSMAR5 and OSMAR10. Like other mariner-like transposases, the OSMARs bind specifically to the terminal inverted repeat (TIR) sequences of their encoding transposons. OSMAR5 binds DNA through a bipartite N-terminal domain containing two functionally separable helix-turn-helix motifs, resembling the paired domain of Tc1-like transposases and PAX transcription factors in metazoans. Furthermore, binding of the OSMARs is not limited to their own TIRs; OSMAR5 transposase can also interact in vitro with TIRs from closely related Osmar elements and with consensus TIRs of several Stowaway families mined from the rice genome sequence. These results provide the first biochemical evidence for a functional relationship between Osmar elements and Stowaway MITEs and lead us to suggest that there is extensive cross-talk among related but distinct transposon families co-existing in a single eukaryote genome.},

title = {k-link EST clustering: evaluating error introduced by chimeric sequences under different degrees of linkage},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The clustering of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is a crucial step in many sequence analysis studies that require a high level of redundancy. Chimeric sequences, while uncommon, can make achieving the optimal EST clustering a challenge. Single-linkage algorithms are particularly vulnerable to the effects of chimeras. To avoid chimera-facilitated erroneous merges, researchers using single-linkage algorithms are forced to use stringent sequence-similarity thresholds. Such thresholds reduce the sensitivity of the clustering algorithm. RESULTS: We introduce the concept of k-link clustering for EST data. We evaluate how clustering error rates vary over a range of linkage thresholds. Using k-link, we show that Type II error decreases in response to increasing the number of shared ESTs (ie. links) required. We observe a base level of Type II error likely caused by the presence of unmasked low-complexity or repetitive sequence. We find that Type I error increases gradually with increased linkage. To minimize the Type I error introduced by increased linkage requirements, we propose an extension to k-link which modifies the required number of links with respect to the size of clusters being compared.

Furthermore, these motifs are found in hypervariable minisatellites and are clustered in the breakpoint regions of both disease-causing nonallelic homologous recombination hot spots and common mitochondrial deletion hot spots, implicating the motif as a driver of genome instability.},

abstract = {Neandertals, the closest evolutionary relatives of present-day humans, lived in large parts of Europe and western Asia before disappearing 30,000 years ago. We present a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome composed of more than 4 billion nucleotides from three individuals. Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.},

title = {Transcription induces strand-specific mutations at the 5' end of human genes},
abstract = {A regional analysis of nucleotide substitution rates along human genes and their flanking regions allows us to quantify the effect of mutational mechanisms associated with transcription in germ line cells. Our analysis reveals three distinct patterns of substitution rates. First, a sharp decline in the deamination rate of methylated CpG dinucleotides, which is observed in the vicinity of the 5' end of genes. Second, a strand asymmetry in complementary substitution rates, which extends from the 5' end to 1 kbp downstream from the 3' end, associated with transcription-coupled repair. Finally, a localized strand asymmetry, an excess of C-->T over G-->A substitution in the nontemplate strand confined to the first 1-2 kbp downstream of the 5' end of genes. We hypothesize that higher exposure of the nontemplate strand near the 5' end of genes leads to a higher cytosine deamination rate. Up to now, only the somatic hypermutation (SHM) pathway has been known to mediate localized and strand-specific mutagenic processes associated with transcription in mammalia. The mutational patterns in SHM are induced by cytosine deaminase, which just targets single-stranded DNA. This DNA conformation is induced by R-loops, which preferentially occur at the 5' ends of genes. We predict that R-loops are extensively formed in the beginning of transcribed regions in germ line cells.},

abstract = {Many of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in GenBank dbEST and community EST assemblies were either over- or undertrimmed in terms of their cDNA termini, which are defined as the diagnostic sequence elements that delineate 3'/5' ends of mRNA transcripts. Overtrimming represents a loss of directional, positional, and structural information of transcript ends whereas undertrimming causes unclean spurious sequences retained in ESTs that exert deleterious impacts on downstream EST-based applications. We examined 309,278 raw EST sequencing trace files of C. reinhardtii and found that only 57% had cDNA termini that matched the expected structures specified in their cDNA library constructions while satisfying our minimum length requirement for their final clean sequences. Using GMAP, 156,963 individual ESTs were mapped to the genome successfully, with their in silico-verified cDNA termini anchored to the genome. Our data analysis suggested strong macro- and microheterogeneity of 3'/5' end positions of individual transcripts derived from the same genes in C. reinhardtii. This work annotating differential ends of individual transcripts in the draft genome presents the research community with a new stream of data that will facilitate accurate determination of gene structures, genome annotation, and exploration of the transcriptome and mRNA metabolism in C. reinhardtii.},

title = {Evaluation of EST-data using the genome assembly},
abstract = {Using expressed sequence tag (EST) data for genomewide studies requires thorough understanding of the nature of the problems that are related to handling these sequences. We investigated how EST clustering performs when the genome is used as guidance as compared to pairwise sequence alignment methods. We show that clustering with the genome as a template outperforms sequence similarity methods used to create other EST clusters, such as the UniGene set, in respect to the extent ESTs originating from the same transcriptional unit are separated into disjunct clusters. Using our approach, approximately 80% of the RefSeq genes were represented by a single EST cluster and 20% comprised of two or more EST clusters. In contrast, approximately 25% of all RefSeq genes were found to be represented by a single cluster for the UniGene clustering method. The approach minimizes the risk for overestimations due to the amount of disjunct clusters originating from the same transcript. We have also investigated the quality of EST-data by aligning ESTs to the genome. The results show how many ESTs are not adequately trimmed in respect of vector sequences and low quality regions. Moreover, we identified important problems related to ESTs aligned to the genome using BLAT, such as inferring splice junctions, and explained this aspect by simulations with synthetic data. EST-clusters created with the method are available upon request from the authors.},

Other important points:
* Test selectivity with homologos genomes
  - Cap3 handles up to 96%
* Create TIGR Gene Indicies
* Error rate model
* Claim: end points are less spread out, hence EST errors are clustered (2000 paper -- outdate claim?)

Many researchers are forging ahead with projects to sequence a range of species using the new technologies. However, these new technologies produce read lengths as short as 35-40 nucleotides, posing challenges for genome assembly and annotation.

abstract = {Although the list of completed genome sequencing projects has expanded rapidly, sequencing and analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) remain a primary tool for discovery of novel genes in many eukaryotes and a key element in genome annotation. The TIGR Gene Indices (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi) are a collection of 77 species-specific databases that use a highly refined protocol to analyze gene and EST sequences in an attempt to identify and characterize expressed transcripts and to present them on the Web in a user-friendly, consistent fashion. A Gene Index database is constructed for each selected organism by first clustering, then assembling EST and annotated cDNA and gene sequences from GenBank. This process produces a set of unique, high-fidelity virtual transcripts, or tentative consensus (TC) sequences. The TC sequences can be used to provide putative genes with functional annotation, to link the transcripts to genetic and physical maps, to provide links to orthologous and paralogous genes, and as a resource for comparative and functional genomic analysis.},

title = {Novel exon combinations generated by alternative splicing of gene fragments mobilized by a CACTA transposon in Glycine max},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent discoveries of transposable elements carrying host gene fragments such as the Pack-MULEs (Mutator-like transposable elements) of maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, the Helitrons of maize and the Tgm-Express of soybeans, revealed a widespread genetic mechanism with the potential to rearrange genomes and create novel chimeric genes affecting genomic and proteomic diversity. Not much is known with regard to the mechanisms of gene fragment capture by those transposon elements or the expression of the captured host gene fragments. There is some evidence that chimeric transcripts can be assembled and exist in EST collections. RESULTS: We report results obtained from analysis of RT-PCR derived cDNAs of the Glycine max mutant flower color gene, wp, that contains a 5.7-kb transposon (Tgm-Express1) in Intron 2 of the flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene (F3H) and is composed of five unrelated host gene fragments. The collection of cDNAs derived from the wp allele represents a multiplicity of processed RNAs varying in length and sequence that includes some identical to the correctly processed mature F3H transcript with three properly spliced exons. Surprisingly, the five gene fragments carried by the Tgm-Express1 were processed through complex alternative splicing as additional exons of the wp transcript. CONCLUSION: The gene fragments carried by the Tgm inverted repeat ends appear to be retained as functional exons/introns within the element. The spliceosomes then select indiscriminately the canonical intron splice sites from a pre-mRNA to assemble diverse chimeric transcripts from the exons contained in the wp allele. The multiplicity and randomness of these events provide some insights into the origin and mechanism of alternatively spliced genes.},

title = {Combined evidence annotation of transposable elements in genome sequences},
abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile, repetitive sequences that make up significant fractions of metazoan genomes. Despite their near ubiquity and importance in genome and chromosome biology, most efforts to annotate TEs in genome sequences rely on the results of a single computational program, RepeatMasker. In contrast, recent advances in gene annotation indicate that high-quality gene models can be produced from combining multiple independent sources of computational evidence. To elevate the quality of TE annotations to a level comparable to that of gene models, we have developed a combined evidence-model TE annotation pipeline, analogous to systems used for gene annotation, by integrating results from multiple homology-based and de novo TE identification methods. As proof of principle, we have annotated "TE models" in Drosophila melanogaster Release 4 genomic sequences using the combined computational evidence derived from RepeatMasker, BLASTER, TBLASTX, all-by-all BLASTN, RECON, TE-HMM and the previous Release 3.1 annotation. Our system is designed for use with the Apollo genome annotation tool, allowing automatic results to be curated manually to produce reliable annotations. The euchromatic TE fraction of D. melanogaster is now estimated at 5.3% (cf. 3.86% in Release 3.1), and we found a substantially higher number of TEs (n = 6,013) than previously identified (n = 1,572). Most of the new TEs derive from small fragments of a few hundred nucleotides long and highly abundant families not previously annotated (e.g., INE-1). We also estimated that 518 TE copies (8.6%) are inserted into at least one other TE, forming a nest of elements. The pipeline allows rapid and thorough annotation of even the most complex TE models, including highly deleted and/or nested elements such as those often found in heterochromatic sequences. Our pipeline can be easily adapted to other genome sequences, such as those of the D. melanogaster heterochromatin or other species in the genus Drosophila.},

title = {Interferon induction by viruses. XVI. 2-Aminopurine blocks selectively and reversibly an early stage in interferon induction},
abstract = {A purine analogue, 2-aminopurine, reported to act as an inhibitor of protein kinase, selectively, reversibly and in a dose-dependent manner blocked a very early stage in interferon induction. With chick embryo cells and mouse L cells as hosts, and different viral inducers of interferon, maximal effects of 2-aminopurine were observed during the first 4 h of induction. At 10 mM-2-aminopurine there was a 20-fold reduction in the yield of interferon from both cell types. 2-Aminopurine and actinomycin D both prevented interferon induction with the same time course, indicating a transcriptional block to induction; however, only the action of the former was reversed upon removal of the drug. Addition of 2-aminopurine to an agarose overlay resulted in high efficiency plaque formation by vesicular stomatitis virus New Jersey (Hazelhurst) under conditions where endogenous induction of interferon and its feedback action on aged chick embryo cells normally prevented plaque formation. Two other inducible systems, representing genes involved in interferon action (both its development and activation), and those of heat shock, were not affected by 2-aminopurine. A model is presented implicating the interferon-inducible dsRNA-dependent protein kinase as an interferon induction receptor which, on interaction with dsRNA, generates an amplified signal via phosphorylation that ultimately derepresses the interferon gene(s).},

title = {Transcription-related mutations and GC content drive variation in nucleotide substitution rates across the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been remarkably little study of nucleotide substitution rate variation among plant nuclear genes, in part because orthology is difficult to establish. Orthology is even more problematic for intergenic regions of plant nuclear genomes, because plant genomes generally harbor a wealth of repetitive DNA. In theory orthologous intergenic data is valuable for studying rate variation because nucleotide substitutions in these regions should be under little selective constraint compared to coding regions. As a result, evolutionary rates in intergenic regions may more accurately reflect genomic features, like recombination and GC content, that contribute to nucleotide substitution. RESULTS: We generated a set of 66 intergenic sequences in Arabidopsis lyrata, a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana. The intergenic regions included transposable element (TE) remnants and regions flanking the TEs. We verified orthology of these amplified regions both by comparison of existing A. lyrata--A. thaliana genetic maps and by using molecular features. We compared substitution rates among the 66 intergenic loci, which exhibit ~5-fold rate variation, and compared intergenic rates to a set of 64 orthologous coding sequences. Our chief observations were that the average rate of nucleotide substitution is slower in intergenic regions than in synonymous sites, that rate variation in both intergenic and coding regions correlate with GC content, that GC content alone is not sufficient to explain differences in rates between intergenic and coding regions, and that rates of evolution in intergenic regions correlate negatively with gene density. CONCLUSION: Our observations indicated that mutation rates vary among genomics regions as a function of base composition, suggesting that previous observations of "selective constraint" on non-coding regions could more accurately be attributed to a GC effect instead of selection. The negative correlation between nucleotide substitution rate and gene density provides a potential neutral explanation for a previously documented correlation between gene density and polymorphism levels within A. thaliana. Finally, we discuss potential forces that could contribute to rapid synonymous rates, and provide evidence to suggest that transcription-related mutation contributes to rate differences between intergenic and synonymous sites.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sparse connectivity of protein-protein interaction data sets makes identification of functional modules challenging. The purpose of this study is to critically evaluate a novel clustering technique for clustering and detecting functional modules in protein-protein interaction networks, termed STM. RESULTS: STM selects representative proteins for each cluster and iteratively refines clusters based on a combination of the signal transduced and graph topology. STM is found to be effective at detecting clusters with a diverse range of interaction structures that are significant on measures of biological relevance. The STM approach is compared to six competing approaches including the maximum clique, quasi-clique, minimum cut, betweeness cut and Markov Clustering (MCL) algorithms. The clusters obtained by each technique are compared for enrichment of biological function. STM generates larger clusters and the clusters identified have p-values that are approximately 125-fold better than the other methods on biological function. An important strength of STM is that the percentage of proteins that are discarded to create clusters is much lower than the other approaches. CONCLUSION: STM outperforms competing approaches and is capable of effectively detecting both densely and sparsely connected, biologically relevant functional modules with fewer discards.},

abstract = {The nucleotide sequence of the L gene of vesicular stomatitis virus, New Jersey serotype (Hazelhurst subtype), was determined. Primer extension dideoxy sequencing of genomic RNA using reverse transcriptase initiated within the adjacent G gene provided a consensus sequence of 6522 nucleotides. The G/L intergenic junction spanned 21 nucleotides and contained a pseudo transcription start signal as well as two sequences (10 and 6 nucleotides in length) which are reiterated within the L coding region. The predicted L mRNA was 6398 nucleotides long and contained a single open reading frame corresponding to an L protein encompassing 2109 amino acids with a MW of 241,546. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of this New Jersey serotype L protein to that previously reported for the L protein of the serologically and genetically distinct Indiana serotype (M. Schubert, G. G. Harmison, and E. Meier (1984). J. Virol. 51, 505-514.) revealed a high degree of functional homology. In addition, six regions (43 to 103 amino acids in length) which displayed a high percentage of identical amino acids (85 to 96%) were identified. Five of these regions were clustered within the amino-terminal half of the L protein. Two of these regions contained sequences, 41 amino acids in length, which were significantly similar to corresponding regions of the L proteins of the paramyxoviruses Sendai and Newcastle disease virus. These structurally conserved regions may correspond to functional domains of the multifunctional L protein.},

The assembler uses iterative multipass strategies centered on high-confidence regions within sequences and has a fallback strategy for using low-confidence regions when needed. It features special functions to assemble high numbers of highly similar sequences without prior masking, an automatic editor that edits and analyzes alignments by inspecting the underlying traces, and detection and classification of sequence properties like SNPs with a high specificity and a sensitivity down to one mutation per sequence. In addition, it includes possibilities to use incorrectly preprocessed sequences, routines to make use of additional sequencing information such as base-error probabilities, template insert sizes, strain information, etc., and functions to detect and resolve possible misassemblies. The assembler is routinely used for such various tasks as mutation detection in different cell types, similarity analysis of transcripts between organisms, and pristine assembly of sequences from various sources for oligo design in clinical microarray experiments.},

journal = {Nucleic Acids Res},
title = {GenBank},
abstract = {GenBank is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for more than 300,000 organisms named at the genus level or lower, obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects, including whole genome shotgun (WGS) and environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and accession numbers are assigned by GenBank staff upon receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Nucleotide Sequence Database in Europe and the DNA Data Bank of Japan ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the NCBI Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bi-monthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP. To access GenBank and its related retrieval and analysis services, begin at the NCBI homepage: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.},
