title = {Efficient clustering of large EST data sets on parallel computers},
abstract = {Clustering expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is a powerful strategy for gene identification, gene expression studies and identifying important genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms. To enable fast clustering of large-scale EST data, we developed PaCE (for Parallel Clustering of ESTs), a software program for EST clustering on parallel computers. In this paper, we report on the design and development of PaCE and its evaluation using Arabidopsis ESTs. The novel features of our approach include: (i) design of memory efficient algorithms to reduce the memory required to linear in the size of the input, (ii) a combination of algorithmic techniques to reduce the computational work without sacrificing the quality of clustering, and (iii) use of parallel processing to reduce run-time and facilitate clustering of larger data sets. Using a combination of these techniques, we report the clustering of 168 200 Arabidopsis ESTs in 15 min on an IBM xSeries cluster with 30 dual-processor nodes. We also clustered 327 632 rat ESTs in 47 min and 420 694 Triticum aestivum ESTs in 3 h and 15 min. We demonstrate the quality of our software using benchmark Arabidopsis EST data, and by comparing it with CAP3, a software widely used for EST assembly. Our software allows clustering of much larger EST data sets than is possible with current software. Because of its speed, it also facilitates multiple runs with different parameters, providing biologists a tool to better analyze EST sequence data. Using PaCE, we clustered EST data from 23 plant species and the results are available at the PlantGDB website.},

abstract = {The number of genes in the human genome is still a controversial issue. Whereas most of the genes in the human genome are said to have been physically or computationally identified, many short cDNA sequences identified as tags by use of serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) do not match these genes. By performing experimental verification of more than 1,000 SAGE tags and analyzing 4,285,923 SAGE tags of human origin in the current SAGE database, we examined the nature of the unmatched SAGE tags. Our study shows that most of the unmatched SAGE tags are truly novel SAGE tags that originated from novel transcripts not yet identified in the human genome, including alternatively spliced transcripts from known genes and potential novel genes. Our study indicates that by using novel SAGE tags as probes, we should be able to identify efficiently many novel transcripts/novel genes in the human genome that are difficult to identify by conventional methods.},

title = {Complementary DNA sequencing: expressed sequence tags and human genome project},
abstract = {Automated partial DNA sequencing was conducted on more than 600 randomly selected human brain complementary DNA (cDNA) clones to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs). ESTs have applications in the discovery of new human genes, mapping of the human genome, and identification of coding regions in genomic sequences. Of the sequences generated, 337 represent new genes, including 48 with significant similarity to genes from other organisms, such as a yeast RNA polymerase II subunit; Drosophila kinesin, Notch, and Enhancer of split; and a murine tyrosine kinase receptor. Forty-six ESTs were mapped to chromosomes after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. This fast approach to cDNA characterization will facilitate the tagging of most human genes in a few years at a fraction of the cost of complete genomic sequencing, provide new genetic markers, and serve as a resource in diverse biological research fields.},

title = {Algorithms for clustering expressed sequence tags: the wcd tool},
abstract = {Understanding which genes are active, and when and why, is an important question for molecular biology.  Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) are a technology used to explore the transcriptome (a record of this gene activity). ESTs are short fragments of DNA created in the laboratory from mRNA extracted from a cell.  The key computational step in their processing is clustering: putting all ESTs associated from the same RNA together. Accurate clustering is quadratic in time in average EST length and number of ESTs, which makes na¨ıve algorithms infeasible for real data sets. The wcd EST clustering system is an open source clustering system that provides efficient implementations of key distance measures, heuristics for speeding up clustering, a pre-clustering booster based on suffix arrays, as well as parallelised implementations based on MPI and Pthreads. This paper presents the underlying algorithms in wcd. The code is available from http://code.google.com/p/wcdest.},

title = {Evaluation of EST-data using the genome assembly},
abstract = {Using expressed sequence tag (EST) data for genomewide studies requires thorough understanding of the nature of the problems that are related to handling these sequences. We investigated how EST clustering performs when the genome is used as guidance as compared to pairwise sequence alignment methods. We show that clustering with the genome as a template outperforms sequence similarity methods used to create other EST clusters, such as the UniGene set, in respect to the extent ESTs originating from the same transcriptional unit are separated into disjunct clusters. Using our approach, approximately 80\% of the RefSeq genes were represented by a single EST cluster and 20\% comprised of two or more EST clusters. In contrast, approximately 25\% of all RefSeq genes were found to be represented by a single cluster for the UniGene clustering method. The approach minimizes the risk for overestimations due to the amount of disjunct clusters originating from the same transcript. We have also investigated the quality of EST-data by aligning ESTs to the genome. The results show how many ESTs are not adequately trimmed in respect of vector sequences and low quality regions. Moreover, we identified important problems related to ESTs aligned to the genome using BLAT, such as inferring splice junctions, and explained this aspect by simulations with synthetic data. EST-clusters created with the method are available upon request from the authors.},

Writeupof error model sent to collaborators:

I've worked through the details of Hazelhurt's simulation, and what probabilities they use for errors.   They have put some time into this, so I suggested we use their model and not try to work this out on our own (with the exceptions noted below).  

They actually detail two different models; here I'm only going to give the parameters for the worst-case.  Jenna: I'm sticking numbers in below, but for your work you are going to want to parametrize it better.  We will go over this later.

To introduce an error they go through the following steps:

Single base errors: They take this in two steps.  First, they determine if a base has an error, then they determine what sort of error. 

To determine if it is subjected to an error:
First, they allow it to change at a probability of 0.01. 
If it did not change in (1), then they give a second change to change based on its distance from the 3' end.  This probability here is 0.02x/l, where x is the index number of the base and l is the length of the est.  (So the first base has a probability of 0 of changing for this reason, and the last base has a probability of 0.02.) 
At the end of the est things get even worse.  So if there was no change in step (1) or (2), they let it change with a probability of exp(-0.5sqrt(l-x)).  (So the first base has a probability of exp(-0.5sqrt(l)) -- very small, while the second-to-last base has a probability 0.606 and the last base has a probability of 1. 
There is also extra problems at the beginning.  So an error can happen with probability 0.5(1 -- tanh(x -- 50)).  Unlike the pervious steps they have no good way of explaining this, but claim it works well.

If a base is subjected to an error: it could be a substitution, deletion or insertion, each with probability 1/3.  (I presume that ``insertion'' means that a new base is inserted right before it.)  For insertion and substitution its not clear to me how the new base is picked; in absence of discussion, I assume that we pick from the other letters with a uniform probability.


Stuttering: This is when a subsequence gets copied.  This is apparently more likely to happen at a T or a G.

They only allow this when there is a sequence of multiple Ts or multiple Gs; they claim that the probability otherwise is negligible.  If we are at position x, let r_G(x) be the number of contiguous Gs that occur up to and including x.  (So for the sequence AGGGA, r_G(0)=0, r_G(1) = 1, r_G(2) = 2, r_G(3) = 3, and r_G(4) = 0.)  Let r_T(x) be the same for Ts.  Then the probability of a stutter (in terms of the parameter \eta) is:

        (0.5(1-cos(r_G(x)/ \eta)))^2 + (0.5(1-cos(r_T(x)/ \eta)))^2

There is a problem here, because they list the value of the parameter \eta as 0, which obviously makes no sense.  In the other experiment (the non-worst case) they list it as 20.


If stuttering does occur at index x, then the length of the insert sequence is chosen from a uniform distribution over the range (0...2*r_G(x)) or (0...2*r_T(x)).



Ligation: This is when two ESTs (possibly from different genes) get bonded together.  They put the probability of this a 0.  Its not clear to me if they do this because it doesn't really happen, or just because they don't know how to deal with it.  

Clearly, this error would be serious, as it could cause us to incorrectly join cluster together.  In the short run, I think we should follow there example and ignore it.  In the long run, I'm hoping we can come up with a detection method.  


Relevance to Chun's work: Part of Chun's work is on cleaning up the endpoints of the EST, so data we get from him will have less errors at the end.  This was have a directly effect on the probabilities being emulated in step (4) of determining if there is a single base error --- reducing that probability of error.  I suspect it will help in step (3) as well.

title = {CLU: a new algorithm for EST clustering},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The continuous flow of EST data remains one of the richest sources for discoveries in modern biology. The first step in EST data mining is usually associated with EST clustering, the process of grouping of original fragments according to their annotation, similarity to known genomic DNA or each other. Clustered EST data, accumulated in databases such as UniGene, STACK and TIGR Gene Indices have proven to be crucial in research areas from gene discovery to regulation of gene expression. RESULTS: We have developed a new nucleotide sequence matching algorithm and its implementation for clustering EST sequences. The program is based on the original CLU match detection algorithm, which has improved performance over the widely used d2_cluster. The CLU algorithm automatically ignores low-complexity regions like poly-tracts and short tandem repeats. CONCLUSION: CLU represents a new generation of EST clustering algorithm with improved performance over current approaches. An early implementation can be applied in small and medium-size projects. The CLU program is available on an open source basis free of charge. It can be downloaded from http://compbio.pbrc.edu/pti.},

title = {EST clustering error evaluation and correction},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The gene expression intensity information conveyed by (EST) Expressed Sequence Tag data can be used to infer important cDNA library properties, such as gene number and expression patterns. However, EST clustering errors, which often lead to greatly inflated estimates of obtained unique genes, have become a major obstacle in the analyses. The EST clustering error structure, the relationship between clustering error and clustering criteria, and possible error correction methods need to be systematically investigated. RESULTS: We identify and quantify two types of EST clustering error, namely, Type I and II in EST clustering using CAP3 assembling program. A Type I error occurs when ESTs from the same gene do not form a cluster whereas a Type II error occurs when ESTs from distinct genes are falsely clustered together. While the Type II error rate is <1.5\% for both 5' and 3' EST clustering, the Type I error in the 5' EST case is approximately 10 times higher than the 3' EST case (30\% versus 3\%). An over-stringent identity rule, e.g., P >/= 95\%, may even inflate the Type I error in both cases. We demonstrate that approximately 80\% of the Type I error is due to insufficient overlap among sibling ESTs (ISO error) in 5' EST clustering. A novel statistical approach is proposed to correct ISO error to provide more accurate estimates of the true gene cluster profile.},

title = {Ubiquitous reassortments in influenza A viruses},
abstract = {The influenza A virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus composed of eight segmented RNA molecules, including polymerases (PB2, PB1, PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (MP), and nonstructure gene (NS). The influenza A viruses are notorious for rapid mutations, frequent reassortments, and possible recombinations. Among these evolutionary events, reassortments refer to exchanges of discrete RNA segments between co-infected influenza viruses, and they have facilitated the generation of pandemic and epidemic strains. Thus, identification of reassortments will be critical for pandemic and epidemic prevention and control. This paper presents a reassortment identification method based on distance measurement using complete composition vector (CCV) and segment clustering using a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. By applying this method, we identified 34 potential reassortment clusters among 2,641 PB2 segments of influenza A viruses. Among the 83 serotypes tested, at least 56 (67.46\%) exchanged their fragments with another serotype of influenza A viruses. These identified reassortments involve 1,957 H2N1 and 1,968 H3N2 influenza pandemic strains as well as H5N1 avian influenza virus isolates, which have generated the potential for a future pandemic threat. More frequent reassortments were found to occur in wild birds, especially migratory birds. This MST clustering program is written in Java and will be available upon request.},

This program can efficiently cluster a huge protein database with millions of sequences. However, the applications of the underlying algorithm are not limited to only protein sequences clustering, here we present several new programs using the same algorithm including cd-hit-2d, cd-hit-est and cd-hit-est-2d. Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a DNA/RNA sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as BLAST.},

Many of the ESTs have been sequenced as an alternative to complete genome sequencing or as a substrate for cDNA array-based expression analyses. This creates a formidable resource from both biodiversity and gene-discovery standpoints. Bioinformatics-based sequence analysis tools have extended the scope of EST analysis into the fields of proteomics, marker development and genome annotation. Although EST collections are certainly no substitute for a whole genome scaffold, this "poor man's genome" resource forms the core foundations for various genome-scale experiments within the as yet unsequenceable plant genomes.},

Most contemporary methods are based on some kind of all-against-all comparison, resulting in a quadratic time complexity. A different approach is needed to keep up with the rapid growth of EST data.

The produced clusterings are validated by comparing them to clusterings produced by other methods, and the results are quite promising.

title = {d2\_cluster: a validated method for clustering EST and full-length cDNAsequences},
abstract = {Several efforts are under way to condense single-read expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length transcript data on a large scale by means of clustering or assembly. One goal of these projects is the construction of gene indices where transcripts are partitioned into index classes (or clusters) such that they are put into the same index class if and only if they represent the same gene. Accurate gene indexing facilitates gene expression studies and inexpensive and early partial gene sequence discovery through the assembly of ESTs that are derived from genes that have yet to be positionally cloned or obtained directly through genomic sequencing. We describe d2_cluster, an agglomerative algorithm for rapidly and accurately partitioning transcript databases into index classes by clustering sequences according to minimal linkage or "transitive closure" rules. We then evaluate the relative efficiency of d2_cluster with respect to other clustering tools. UniGene is chosen for comparison because of its high quality and wide acceptance. It is shown that although d2_cluster and UniGene produce results that are between 83\% and 90\% identical, the joining rate of d2_cluster is between 8\% and 20\% greater than UniGene. Finally, we present the first published rigorous evaluation of under and over clustering (in other words, of type I and type II errors) of a sequence clustering algorithm, although the existence of highly identical gene paralogs means that care must be taken in the interpretation of the type II error. Upper bounds for these d2_cluster error rates are estimated at 0.4\% and 0.8\%, respectively. In other words, the sensitivity and selectivity of d2_cluster are estimated to be >99.6\% and 99.2\%.},

Highly efficient automatic screening of the data allows deposition of the annotated sequences without delay. Sequences have been generated from 26 oligo(dT) primed directionally cloned libraries, of which 18 were normalized. The libraries were constructed using mRNA isolated from 17 different tissues representing three developmental states. Comparisons of a subset of our data with nonredundant human mRNA and protein data bases show that the ESTs represent many known sequences and contain many that are novel. Analysis of protein families using Hidden Markov Models confirms this observation and supports the contention that although normalization reduces significantly the relative abundance of redundant cDNA clones, it does not result in the complete removal of members of gene families.},

title = {Characterizing the D2 statistic: word matches in biological sequences},
abstract = {Word matches are often used in sequence comparison methods, either as a measure of sequence similarity or in the first search steps of algorithms such as BLAST or BLAT. The D2 statistic is the number of matches of words of k letters between two sequences. Recent advances have been made in the characterization of this statistic and in the approximation of its distribution. Here, these results are extended to the case of approximate word matches. We compute the exact value of the variance of the D2 statistic for the case of a uniform letter distribution, and introduce a method to provide accurate approximations of the variance in the remaining cases. This enables the distribution of D2 to be approximated for typical situations arising in biological research. We apply these results to the identification of cis-regulatory modules, and show that this method detects such sequences with a high accuracy. The ability to approximate the distribution of D2 for both exact and approximate word matches will enable the use of this statistic in a more precise manner for sequence comparison, database searches, and identification of transcription factor binding sites.},
