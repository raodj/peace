Motivation: Clustering genomic data, including those generated via
high-throughput sequencing, is an important preliminary step for
assembly and analysis. However, clustering a large number of sequences
is time-consuming. Methods: In this paper, we discuss algorithmic
performance improvements to our existing clustering system called
PEACE via the following two new approaches: (1) using Approximate
Spanning Tree (AST) that is computed much faster than the currently
used Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) approach, and (2) a novel Prime
Numbers based Heuristic (PNH) for generating features and comparing
them to further reduce comparison overheads. Results: Experiments
conducted using a variety of data sets show that the proposed method
significantly improves performance for datasets with large clusters
with only minimal degradation in clustering quality. We also compare
our methods against wcd-kaboom, a state-of-the-art clustering
software.  Our experiments show that with AST and PNH underperform
wcd-kaboom for datasets that have many small clusters.  However, they
significantly outperform wcd-kaboom for datasets with large clusters
by a conspicuous ~550x with comparable clustering quality.  The
results indicate that the proposed methods hold considerable promise
for accelerating clustering of genomic data with large clusters.
