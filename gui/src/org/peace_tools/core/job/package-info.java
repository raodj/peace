 * <p>
 * This package contains the classes associated with the job
 * wizard. The job wizard guides the user through the process of
 * launching a new job (to compute MST and clustering) on a server.
 * </p> 
 *
 * <p>This is a pretty involved wizard as a job can have many 
 * different options and parameters to configure the operations
 * performed by the PEACE's C++ clustering engine. This wizard
 * has been designed to be consistent with the core infrastructure
 * provided by {@link org.peace_tools.generic.WizardDialog}.
